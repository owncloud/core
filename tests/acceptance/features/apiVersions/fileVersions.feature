Feature: dav-versions

  Background:
    Given using OCS API version "2"
    And using new DAV path
    And user "Alice" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files

  Scenario: Upload file and no version is available
    When user "Alice" uploads file "filesForUpload/davtest.txt" to "/davtest.txt" using the WebDAV API
    Then the version folder of file "/davtest.txt" for user "Alice" should contain "0" elements

  @issue-ocis-reva-17 @issue-ocis-reva-56
  Scenario: Upload file and no version is available using various chunking methods (except new chunking)
    When user "Alice" uploads file "filesForUpload/davtest.txt" to filenames based on "/davtest.txt" with all mechanisms except new chunking using the WebDAV API
    Then the version folder of file "/davtest.txt-olddav-regular" for user "Alice" should contain "0" elements
    And the version folder of file "/davtest.txt-newdav-regular" for user "Alice" should contain "0" elements
    And the version folder of file "/davtest.txt-olddav-oldchunking" for user "Alice" should contain "0" elements
