Feature: PROPPATCH file/folder

  Background:
    Given these users have been created with default attributes and without skeleton files:
      | username |
      | Alice    |
      | Brian    |
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "some data" to "/textfile0.txt"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "some data" to "/textfile1.txt"
    And user "Alice" has created folder "/PARENT"
    And user "Alice" has created folder "/FOLDER"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "some data" to "/PARENT/parent.txt"

  Scenario: send PROPPATCH requests to webDav endpoints as normal user with wrong password
    When user "Alice" requests these endpoints with "PROPPATCH" including body "doesnotmatter" using password "invalid" about user "Alice"
      | endpoint                                           |
      | /remote.php/webdav/textfile0.txt                   |

      | /remote.php/dav/files/%username%/PARENT            |
      | /remote.php/dav/files/%username%/PARENT/parent.txt |
    Then the HTTP status code of responses on all endpoints should be "401"

    Then the HTTP status code of responses on all endpoints should be "404"


  Scenario: send PROPPATCH requests to webDav endpoints using invalid username but correct password
    When user "usero" requests these endpoints with "PROPPATCH" including body "doesnotmatter" using the password of user "Alice"
      | endpoint                                           |

  @issue-ocis-reva-37
  Scenario: send PROPPATCH requests to webDav endpoints using token authentication should not work
    Given token auth has been enforced
    And a new browser session for "Alice" has been started
    And the user has generated a new app password named "my-client"
    When the user requests these endpoints with "PROPPATCH" using the generated app password about user "Alice"
      | endpoint                                           |
      | /remote.php/webdav/textfile0.txt                   |

      | /remote.php/webdav/PARENT                          |
      | /remote.php/dav/files/%username%/PARENT            |
      | /remote.php/dav/files/%username%/PARENT/parent.txt |
    Then the HTTP status code of responses on all endpoints should be "401"

  @issue-ocis-reva-37
  Scenario: send PROPPATCH requests to webDav endpoints using app password token as password
    Given token auth has been enforced
    And a new browser session for "Alice" has been started
    And the user has generated a new app password named "my-client"
    When the user "Alice" requests these endpoints with "PROPPATCH" to set property "favorite" using basic auth and generated app password about user "Alice"
      | endpoint                                           |
      | /remote.php/webdav/textfile0.txt                   |
