Feature: MOVE file/folder

  Background:
    Given these users have been created with default attributes and without skeleton files:
      | username |
      | Alice    |
      | Brian    |
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "some data" to "/textfile0.txt"
    And user "Alice" has created folder "/PARENT"
    And user "Alice" has created folder "/FOLDER"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "some data" to "/PARENT/parent.txt"

  Scenario: send MOVE requests to webDav endpoints as normal user with wrong password
    When user "Alice" requests these endpoints with "MOVE" using password "invalid" about user "Alice"
      | endpoint                                           |
      | /remote.php/webdav/textfile0.txt                   |
      | /remote.php/dav/files/%username%/textfile0.txt     |
      | /remote.php/webdav/PARENT                          |
      | /remote.php/dav/files/%username%/PARENT            |
      | /remote.php/dav/files/%username%/PARENT/parent.txt |
    Then the HTTP status code of responses on all endpoints should be "401"

  Scenario: send MOVE requests to webDav endpoints as normal user with no password
    When user "Alice" requests these endpoints with "MOVE" using password "" about user "Alice"

      | /remote.php/dav/files/%username%/PARENT            |
      | /remote.php/dav/files/%username%/PARENT/parent.txt |
    Then the HTTP status code of responses on all endpoints should be "403"


  Scenario: send MOVE requests to webDav endpoints using invalid username but correct password
    When user "usero" requests these endpoints with "MOVE" using the password of user "Alice"
      | endpoint                                           |

      | /remote.php/dav/files/%username%/PARENT/parent.txt |
    Then the HTTP status code of responses on all endpoints should be "401"

  @smokeTest @skipOnBruteForceProtection @issue-brute_force_protection-112
  Scenario: send MOVE requests to webDav endpoints without any authentication
    When a user requests these endpoints with "MOVE" with no authentication about user "Alice"
      | endpoint                                           |
      | /remote.php/webdav/textfile0.txt                   |

  @issue-ocis-reva-37
  Scenario: send MOVE requests to webDav endpoints using token authentication should not work
    Given token auth has been enforced
    And a new browser session for "Alice" has been started
    And the user has generated a new app password named "my-client"
    When the user requests these endpoints with "MOVE" using the generated app password about user "Alice"
      | endpoint                                           |
      | /remote.php/webdav/textfile0.txt                   |
      | /remote.php/dav/files/%username%/textfile0.txt     |
      | /remote.php/webdav/PARENT                          |
      | /remote.php/dav/files/%username%/PARENT            |
      | /remote.php/dav/files/%username%/PARENT/parent.txt |
    Then the HTTP status code of responses on all endpoints should be "401"

  @issue-ocis-reva-37
  Scenario: send MOVE requests to webDav endpoints using app password token as password
    Given token auth has been enforced
    And a new browser session for "Alice" has been started
    And the user has generated a new app password named "my-client"
    When the user "Alice" requests these endpoints with "MOVE" with body "doesnotmatter" using basic auth and generated app password about user "Alice"
      | endpoint                                           |
      # The token was valid and accepted but the body is invalid so it gives 403
      | /remote.php/webdav/textfile0.txt                   |
      | /remote.php/dav/files/%username%/textfile1.txt     |

      | /remote.php/webdav/PARENT                          |
      | /remote.php/dav/files/%username%/FOLDER            |
    Then the HTTP status code of responses on all endpoints should be "403"

  Scenario: send MOVE requests to webDav endpoints with body as normal user
    When user "Alice" requests these endpoints with "MOVE" including body "doesnotmatter" about user "Alice"
      | endpoint                                           |
