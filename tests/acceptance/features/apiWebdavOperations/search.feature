Feature: Search
  As a user
  I would like to be able to search for files
  So that I can find needed files quickly

  Background:
    Given user "user0" has been created with default attributes
    And user "user0" has created folder "/just-a-folder"
    And user "user0" has created folder "/फनी näme"
    And user "user0" has created folder "/upload folder"
    And user "user0" has created folder "/upload😀 😁"
    And user "user0" has uploaded file with content "does-not-matter" to "/upload.txt"
    And user "user0" has uploaded file with content "does-not-matter" to "/a-image.png"
    And user "user0" has uploaded file with content "does-not-matter" to "/just-a-folder/upload.txt"
    And user "user0" has uploaded file with content "does-not-matter" to "/just-a-folder/lolol.txt"
    And user "user0" has uploaded file with content "does-not-matter" to "/just-a-folder/a-image.png"
    And user "user0" has uploaded file with content "does-not-matter" to "/just-a-folder/uploadÜठिF.txt"
    And user "user0" has uploaded file with content "does-not-matter" to "/फनी näme/upload.txt"
    And user "user0" has uploaded file with content "does-not-matter" to "/फनी näme/a-image.png"
    And user "user0" has uploaded file with content "does-not-matter" to "/upload😀 😁/upload😀 😁.txt"
