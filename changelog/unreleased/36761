Bugfix: Remove part files when upload is cancelled for all public links

Remove part files when the upload is cancelled for the public links.
Prior to this change, it was noticed that for `Upload Only` and
`Download / View / Upload` the part files were not cleaned up. With this
change it does clean up.
