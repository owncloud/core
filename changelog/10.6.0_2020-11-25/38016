Bugfix: Do not emit "share.failedpasswordcheck" events for authenticated links

ShareManager was checking password of already authenticated public links.
This situation led to wrong "share.failedpasswordcheck" events emitting in already authenticated links.
This problem has been resolved by first checking link already authenticated.
