Enhancement: getShare API request's "subfiles" parameter allows new interactions

Previously, the "subfiles" parameter required only the "path" parameter, and
the rest of the parameters were ignored.

Now, the "subfiles" parameter still requires the "path" parameter, but it also
interacts with the "reshares" parameter as well as the "share_types" parameter
to provide additional filtering capabilities
