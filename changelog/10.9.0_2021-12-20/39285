Enhancement: Allow empty folder uploads via webUI

Before this change, drag and drop of an empty folder did not work, there was no
response in the webUI.
While uploading a folder with a text file and an empty folder,
the folder with the text file was created but the empty folder wasn't.

These empty folder upload scenarios work now.
