Enhancement: Extend occ dav:cleanup-chunks command with local option

If an admin runs a setup with multiple servers, connected to the same database
and sets the configuration for the chunking directory 'dav.chunk_base_dir' to a
unique place on the server, the command occ dav:cleanup-chunks might fail.
This happens as the oc_filecache table doesn't give us the information on which
server the directory is.
Therefore the local option has been added to the command, with this precondition
only files that are on the local filesystem will be removed.
