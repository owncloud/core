Change: Use "federated" rather than "remote" for shares

Shares from one ownCloud to another ownCloud were referred to in some places as
remote shares and in other places as federated shares. References to remote
shares in error messages and on the user interface have been changed to
references to federated shares. All user-facing text now calls these federated
shares.
