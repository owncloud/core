Enhancement: Trim spaces while creating, uploading or renaming entities in webUI

With this change starting or trailing spaces will be removed while:
* Creating files and folders in the webUI
* Uploading files using the 'Upload' button in the webUI
* Uploading files and folders using drag & drop in the webUI
* Renaming files and folders in the webUI

This also solves problems when the sync client can't sync files and folders
with trailing spaces based on the underlying file system.
