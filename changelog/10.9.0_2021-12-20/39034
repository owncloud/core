Bugfix: avoid potential open_basedir errors after upgrade to PHP 7.4.21

PHP 7.4.21 checks open_basedir settings more exactly. Calls to file_exists can
emit log messages like "file_exists(): open_basedir restriction in effect" that
were not emitted by PHP 7.4.20.

This change fixes an incorrect file_exists check. The open_basedir message will
no longer be emitted in this case.
