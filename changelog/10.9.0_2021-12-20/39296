Enhancement: Optimized preview for text files

Previews for text files are generated a bit faster. The preview will be
generated based on the first 2 KB of content. In addition to common Latin
script, texts using Han, Hiragana, Katakana, Hangul, Devanagari and Arabic
scripts will also be shown. Note that a text with mixed scripts won't be
previewed properly.
