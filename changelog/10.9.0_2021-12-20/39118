Enhancement: Extend transfer ownership cmd with option to transfer entire user

Command occ files:transfer-ownership now includes flag --destination-use-user-folder <user-id>
that allows to transfer all user files and shares to destination user that has never logged in. 
This is helpful in situation when users need to be migrated to new accounts.
