Bugfix: Prevent unneeded call to LDAP during login with local users

Previously, when the user_ldap app was enabled, any login with a local user
would check the LDAP server for that user even though it shouldn't be needed.

Now, such call won't happen if it has been handled by a different component.
In particular, login with a local user won't trigger that request to LDAP.
