Bugfix: Do not try to login via auth module if the user is disabled

Trying to login via an auth module (such as OAuth2) created a new session
token even if the user was disabled. This was causing errors to appear in the logs
because the new session token created after enabling the user was in use.
Now, a disabled user won't create that session token.
