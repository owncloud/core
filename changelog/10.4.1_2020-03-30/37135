Bugfix: Add share type to the verifyExpirationDate hook

The verifyExpirationDate hook notifies the password_policy app about proposed
expiration dates of shares. The share type was not being passed in the hook.
This meant that the password_policy app incorrectly processed user and group
share expiration dates. See the linked issue for details.
The problem has been corrected.
