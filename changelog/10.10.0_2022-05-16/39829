Bugfix: Fix issue when encryption is enabled and a file is moved out of the share

When encryption was used, moving a file out of a shared folder caused the
versions of the file to get broken. The file was moved correctly though. This
happened due to the key file not being copied to the new location and a new
key file being generated for the file.
Now, the key file is properly copied to the new location, so the versions can
be decrypted properly.
