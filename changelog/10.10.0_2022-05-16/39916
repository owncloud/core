Enhancement: Changes regarding cookie handling

The following changes have been implemented:
* The expiration set for the passphrase cookie will be refreshed each time
a page is loaded or when the "heartbeat" endpoint is hit
* If the "session_keepalive" config option is set to true, a periodic request
to the "heartbeat" endpoint will be made automatically regardless of any
activity going on. This will extend the session lifetime preventing its
expiration.
* If the "session_keepalive" config option is set to false, a "heartbeat" will
be sent based on activity in order to extend the session lifetime. If we
don't detect any activity, the session might expire, and the user will need to
login again.
* The new "session_forced_logout_timeout" option has been added to the
config.php. It's disabled by default, and setting a positive (non-zero) value
will enable the feature. If it's enabled, the passphrase cookie will expire
after those number of seconds pass, when the tab or the browser closes.
This will force the user to login again.
