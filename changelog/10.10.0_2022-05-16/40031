Bugfix: Allow partial initialization of the FS

Previously, when the FS was initialized, we needed to make a request
to the LDAP server in order to fetch the possible group shares of the
user. Some commands only accessed to the trashbin or versions, and
operated for a target user, so accessing to the LDAP server to fetch
groups that wouldn't be used doesn't make much sense.

Now, the commands have the ability to initialize the FS partially,
meaning that no additional mount point other than the home one will
be mounted. In particular, this affects shares and external storages.
Anyway, the commands that have been modified don't need such access. The
main advantage is that now, those commands can operate without a working
connection to the LDAP server because the users will be fetched from the
DB and they don't operate with groups.
