   The web updater is a relic of the past and not recommended for a long time. At
   the end it can cause more pain than help.

   integration in the admin ui.

   a hardcoded list.

   Prevent access to app config where the key is prefixed with remote_ and public_

   be exposed via the network.

* Bugfix - Handle no longer existing user in preview cleanup: [#41247](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/41247)

   A no longer existing user no longer causes an exception in the preview cleanup
   job.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/41247

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/41252
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/41253

* Bugfix - No update check if not connected to the internet: [#41262](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/41262)

   In case an owncloud instance is not connected to the internet there is no need

* Bugfix - Default value of preview_max_dimensions is now 6016x6016: [#41263](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/41263)

   This allows processing of 4K portrait images by default.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/41263

* Bugfix - AllConfig::getUserKeys to return string[] only: [#41270](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/41270)

   The array returned by getUserKeys() is now always an array of strings.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/41270

* Bugfix - Wrong Logic When 'allow_user_mounting' is Initially Undefined: [#41272](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/41272)

   On a freshly installed system, the checkbox '[ ] Allow users to mount external
   storage' is not set, implying 'no'. The code handled this as 'yes' until the
   admin once selected and unselected the checkbox.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/41272
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/41273

* Bugfix - Log.conditions with `shared_secret` shall not break file uploads: [#41044](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/41044)

   Any file upload (or PUT request in general) could cause a 500/Internal Server

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/41044

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/41050

* Bugfix - Store user information in explicit variable: [#41054](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/41054)

   now.

   https://github.com/owncloud/enterprise/issues/5873
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/41054

* Bugfix - Fix expiration date and eliminate duplicate entries in file list: [#41056](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/41056)

   We've addressed two visual issues in the web ui file list. Firstly, the problem
   where the start of the epoch was mistakenly displayed as an expiration date in
   the shared file list has been resolved. Secondly, we've tackled the pesky bug
   causing duplicate entries to appear when switching between shared tabs and
   clicking on a file list entry.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/41056

* Bugfix - LDAP groups will be properly applied to external storages: [#41063](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/41063)

   The admin can setup external storages to be used by specific users and groups.
   When a LDAP group was setup, there were some issues so users belonging to that
   group weren't able to access the external storage even though they should.

   Now, users belonging to LDAP groups can access external storages configured to
   be accessed by those groups.

[10.13.3]: https://github.com/owncloud/core/compare/v10.13.2...v10.13.3

## Summary

* Bugfix - Fix potential issue with the PreviewCleanup job in postgresql: [#41051](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/41051)
* Bugfix - Revert https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/41014 for performance: [#41059](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/41059)
* Bugfix - Users can only delete their own external storage configurations: [#41092](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/41092)
* Enhancement - Update config.apps.sample.php: [#41104](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/41104)

## Details

* Bugfix - Fix potential issue with the PreviewCleanup job in postgresql: [#41051](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/41051)

   One of the filters of the preview cleanup job requires casting a filename, which
   is supposed to contain only digits, to an integer. The expected execution of the
   DB query should have filtered the results so the condition above should be true,
   but the DB's query planner might choose to apply the filters in a different way,
   so we could potentially cast random strings to integer. For the case of
   postgresql, the cast function will cause an error if the string can't be casted
   to an integer (because it has non-digit chars, for example)

   This situation is fixed for all the supported DBs, so we don't require the query
   planner to execute the query in any particular way.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/41051

* Bugfix - Revert https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/41014 for performance: [#41059](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/41059)

   The https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/41014 PR introduced performance
   problems for large installation. We're reverting that change

# Changelog for ownCloud Core [10.13.2] (2023-10-04)

The following sections list the changes in ownCloud core 10.13.2 relevant to
ownCloud admins and users.

[10.13.2]: https://github.com/owncloud/core/compare/v10.13.1...v10.13.2

## Summary

* Bugfix - Delete all files from object store when user is deleted: [#40959](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40959)
* Bugfix - Allow subadmins to read app config values: [#40961](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40961)
* Bugfix - Remove regular expression from Preview Manager list: [#40990](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40990)
* Bugfix - Check if account creation time exists for migrations: [#40991](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40991)
* Bugfix - Do not mount shared storage which are failing: [#41014](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/41014)
* Change - Update PHP dependencies: [#40983](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40983)
* Enhancement - Improve preview cleanup query: [#40974](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40974)
* Enhancement - Remove "Fill E-Tags" Repair-Step: [#40996](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40996)

## Details

* Bugfix - Delete all files from object store when user is deleted: [#40959](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40959)

   As soon as a user is deleted files will also be removed from object storage
   (s3). In previous versions when a user was deleted, files belonging to this user
   were not correctly removed from the object storage (s3) and were therefore left
   as remnants taking unnecessary space. This has been corrected and files are now
   properly removed.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40959

* Bugfix - Allow subadmins to read app config values: [#40961](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40961)

   Previously, subadmins couldn't read app config values. This caused problems in
   the users page for subadmins because some of the functionalities of the page
   were depending on the config values that the subadmins couldn't read. Those
   problems are now solved.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40961

* Bugfix - Remove regular expression from Preview Manager list: [#40990](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40990)

   We removed the regular expression related to HEIC and HEIF files from the
   Preview Manager list as this was preventing the files_mediaviewer app from
   correctly interpreting such mime types. The app is now able to open such files.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40990

* Bugfix - Check if account creation time exists for migrations: [#40991](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40991)

   In some rare scenarios it could have happened that the migration responsible for
   adding the creation time in the oc_accounts table was not correctly inserted
   into oc_migrations with the consequence that it was reattempted i.e. when
   upgrading apps, even if the column was already present. This has been now fixed.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40991

* Bugfix - Do not mount shared storage which are failing: [#41014](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/41014)

   Some mounts use a shared storage, which points to a different storage. If the
   underlying storage is removed, the share mount was still being present as if the
   underlying storage could still be accessed. This was causing problems with the
   `occ files:remove-storage --show-candidates` command because the removed storage
   wasn't shown as possible candidate.

   Now, that share storage won't be mounted, and the underlying storage will be
   detected as a candidate to be removed with the command above.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/41014

* Change - Update PHP dependencies: [#40983](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40983)

   The following have been updated: - phpseclib/phpseclib (3.0.21 to 3.0.23) -
   symfony/string (5.4.26 to 5.4.29)

   The following have been updated in apps/files_external/3rdparty: -
   google/apiclient (2.15.0 to 2.15.1)

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40983
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40986
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/41012

* Enhancement - Improve preview cleanup query: [#40974](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40974)

   Improve the performance of the query to find the previews we need to cleanup in
   the DB

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40974

* Enhancement - Remove "Fill E-Tags" Repair-Step: [#40996](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40996)

   This legacy repair-step took very long to run during an upgrade of a large
   system and didn't repair anything anymore.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40944

* Bugfix - Fix usort callback functions to return integers: [#40945](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40945)

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40945

* Bugfix - Users page generates error logs in owncloud.log: [#40947](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40947)

   corrected so that entries are no longer generated.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/40946
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40947

* Bugfix - No external icons in app registry: [#40955](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40955)

* Enhancement - Improve the performance of the occ files:remove-storage command: [#40859](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40859)

## Details

* Bugfix - Align to new accounts.google.com authorization URI: [#40783](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40783)

   Core 10.12.1 brought an update of the google/apiclient from version 2.12.6 to
   2.13.1. However, in version 2.13.0 the accounts.google.com authorization URI has
   been updated. This change breaks old code that uses the
   "setApprovalPrompt('force')" instead of the newer "setPrompt('consent')" method,
   as this endpoint does not support the legacy approval prompt parameter. This has
   been now fixed.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40783

* Bugfix - Always return an int for the Symfony Command execute method: [#40793](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40793)

   Some occ commands could return an invalid exit status when executed. This has
   been corrected. occ commands will now always return an integer exit status. Zero
   (0) is success, any other value indicates a problem.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40793

* Bugfix - Exit with success when signing-key has been set: [#40794](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40794)

   The "occ security:sign-key:create" command exited with status 1 even when the
   signing key was successfully created. This has been corrected. The command now
   exits with status zero (0) when the command succeeded.

   For all occ commands, zero (0) is success, any other value indicates a problem.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40794

* Bugfix - Fix query used to delete thumbnails: [#40800](https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/40800)

   Fixed query that detects unused thumbnails to prevent unnecessary deletes and
   potential recreations.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/40800
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40801

* Bugfix - Always use json for federation post and get to exchange tokens: [#40815](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40815)

   After update of guzzle, it was no longer possible to request format of response
   to be json when adding in query parameter. One of OCSAuthAPIController fed
   instances was receiving requests without a hint that JSON needs to be used, and
   returned XML. On the other hand, OCSAuthAPIController expects only JSON for
   exchange, and thus failed to parse the message. Now the exchange is correctly
   done.

   WARNING: the patch/fix needs to be applied on all federated severs that are not
   yet "paired" and have the issue with guzzle library. Otherwise pairing will not
   work.

* Bugfix - Rare undefined variable error when using a Google Drive mount: [#40822](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40822)

   There can be the rare case that deleting a file from a Google Drive mount can
   throw an undefined variable error. Though the process completes without further
   issues, no errors should be thrown. This fix initializes the variables for these
   cases properly making the error go away.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/40802
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40822

* Bugfix - Explicitly set open mode in the checksum wrapper: [#40832](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40832)

   Uploading files to some external storages through the desktop client was causing
   issues due to the checksum wrapper. We're using additional wrappers and the mode
   wasn't being detected correctly in some cases. Using the right mode in the
   checksum wrapper was required in order to decide whether we should discard the
   final checksum or not; in this case, the checksum was being discarded, so it was
   causing a checksum mismatch.

   Now the open mode in the checksum wrapper is set explicitly.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40832

* Bugfix - Rely on the server to sort the user list: [#40840](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40840)

   Previously, the user list was sorted in the browser. This was causing confusion
   because the sorting happened with just the items being shown without taking into
   account all the items, so there were some weird effects.

   There is no sorting in the browser now. The server is expected to return the
   list of users already sorted, so the browser just needs to show the list.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40840

* Bugfix - Automatically disable online updater for enterprise: [#40841](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40841)

   Online updater is not recommended for Enterprise installations and is now
   automatically disabled in such cases.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40841

* Bugfix - Verbose command output: [#40844](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40844)

   Verbose command output of the background:queue:execute is now displayed.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40844

* Bugfix - Versions expire job does not error with federated shares: [#40847](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40847)

   Versions expire job does not error with federated shares when versioning meta-
   data is enabled.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40847

* Bugfix - Request header can hold an empty string if not set: [#40856](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40856)

   Due to Apache rewrite rules originally not existing headers can hold an empty
   string.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40856

* Bugfix - DAV storage should return false on stat() if connection fails: [#40861](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40861)

   Trying to connect an external WebDAV storage to a non-WebDAV server will now
   fail when trying to initiate the first connection. This prevents connecting to
   an invalid server, and thus prevents problems for users.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40861

* Bugfix - Skip share_folder for guest users: [#40864](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40864)

   In https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40378 we've fixed the case of (not)
   moving the share target when the backend storage becomes temporary unavailable
   but we had the collateral effect that guests did not see anymore their received
   shares as we were forcing the creation of the target which failed for them as
   their storage is read-only. We now skip the share_folder config.php option for
   guests and default to root.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40864

* Bugfix - Bump files app version: [#40878](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40878)

   Files app version was not properly increased when the
   "OCA\Files\BackgroundJob\CleanupPersistentFileLock" and
   "OCA\Files\BackgroundJob\PreviewCleanupJob" background jobs were originally
   added. As a result, those two jobs were not correctly inserted into the
   "oc_jobs" table upon a core upgrade. First time installations are not affected
   as there jobs are correctly added.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40878

* Bugfix - Apply same restrictions for all the shares: [#40885](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40885)

   Remote shares will have the same restrictions as user and group shares. This
   means that the in order for a remote user to show up as sharee, the search term
   length must be greater than the minimum configured, otherwise only exact matches
   will be shown.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40885

* Bugfix - Cleanup storage and database after failed files uploads: [#40892](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40892)

   Storage and database is cleaned up of any remaining items in case a files upload
   fails.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40892

* Change - Upgrade to Symfony 5: [#39630](https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/39630)

* Change - Fix name length check on federated shares: [#40726](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40726)

   A federated share with a too long name results in potentially inaccessible data.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40726

* Change - Validate email and string user input in UserController: [#40769](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40769)

   User input is validated now in UserController

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40769

* Change - Remove the "add group" button from the dropdowns in the users page: [#40770](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40770)

   The "add group" button has been removed from the dropdowns because the behavior
   was confusing. You can still create new groups in the users page by using the
   "add group" button in the top left corner of the users page. The dropdowns will
   only select existing groups, but they won't add new groups.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40770

* Change - Fix hiding Last Login column on Users page: [#40771](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40771)

   The Last Login column on the Users page is now correctly hidden if the setting
   is initially unchecked.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40771

* Change - Fix name length check on system tag creation: [#40804](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40804)

   A system tag with a too long name results in potentially inaccessible data.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40804

* Change - Display and delete invalid background jobs: [#40846](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40846)

   Background jobs can be no longer valid because they are from an old version of
   an app, or from an app that has been disabled. These jobs can now be listed with
   the command:

   Occ background:queue:status --display-invalid-jobs

   And can be deleted with the command:

   Occ background:queue:delete <Job ID>

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40846
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40917

* Change - Require firebase/php-jwt in core: [#40901](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40901)

   Firebase/php-jwt version 6 is now part of core and all apps can rely on it

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40901
   https://github.com/owncloud/files_texteditor/pull/401
   https://github.com/owncloud/wopi/pull/254

* Enhancement - Add support for OCM via ScienceMesh: [#40577](https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/40577)

   We've added an if-statement in the files_sharing ShareesController code that
   searches for remote sharees. When the 'sciencemesh' app is installed, use it
   instead of the federatedfilesharing app to find sharee matches for OCM sharing.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/40577
   https://github.com/pondersource/oc-sciencemesh/pull/39

* Enhancement - Improve X-Robots-Tag header values check: [#40715](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40715)

   Setup checks now allows other values other than "none" for X-Robots-Tag header.
   If "none" or "noindex" and "nofollow" are missing, a security warning is raised.
   Previously a header value with "noindex" and "nofollow" wasn't allowed even
   though it was valid.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40715

* Enhancement - Added occ command to remove obsolete storages: [#40779](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40779)

   Metadata coming from storages are stored in the DB. When a storage has been
   removed from ownCloud, that metadata remains in the DB.

   The new occ command allows you to remove that metadata stored, reducing the
   amount of space used by the DB as well as slightly improving the performance
   since there will be less entries.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40779

* Enhancement - Add commands to handle the trusted servers from command line: [#40796](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40796)

   New occ commands have been added to handle the trusted servers for federation
   from command line. These commands will allow the admin to add list and remove
   trusted servers

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40796

* Enhancement - Enforce 2-factor authentication: [#40830](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40830)

   2-factor authentication can be enforced now. The feature requires at least an
   app implementing the 2-factor, otherwise no enforcement will be done. If the
   2-factor authentication is enforced, all users will be required to use a
   2-factor authentication app. Some specific groups selected by the admin can be
   excluded to let those users bypass the 2-factor authentication.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40830

* Enhancement - Improve the performance of the occ files:remove-storage command: [#40859](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40859)

   The "--show-candidates" option of the "occ files:remove-storage" command will
   take less time

## Summary

* Bugfix - Respect User Home Folder Naming Rule home directory for chunks uploads: [#40693](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40693)
* Bugfix - Add rewrite base to .htaccess: [#40697](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40697)

* Change - Do not auto-enable user-key encryption: [#40702](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40702)

## Details

* Bugfix - Respect User Home Folder Naming Rule home directory for chunks uploads: [#40693](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40693)

   When using the User Home Folder Naming Rule (configurable in the Advanced tab of
   the LDAP wizard), which allows to specify the home folder by means of an LDAP
   attribute, chunks of users' uploads were wrongly created under the default data
   directory rather than inside the configured home directory. We are now using the
   getHome() method for getting the user's home so that chunks uploads respect the
   configured home directory.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40693
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40719

* Bugfix - Add rewrite base to .htaccess: [#40697](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40697)

   In previous core versions the rewrite base config.php option was not added to
   the generated .htaccess file. The use of a more hardened .htaccess file in
   version 10.12.0 (being introduced by
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40584) caused the files view in the web UI
   to be empty in URL via subfolder plus index.php-less setups. Additionally, the
   desktop app was not be able to sync and an error 405 (Method not allowed) was
   returned. Rewrite base is now correctly added to the .htaccess file.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/40696
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40697

* Bugfix - Prevent 507 Insufficient Storage on 32-bit systems: [#40709](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40709)

   With the introduction of https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40567
   compatibility to 32-bit systems broke as we are now casting $freeSpace to int
   and this caused an integer overflow on such systems when the free space was
   above the max supported value. We added therefore an additional check for 32-bit
   systems in QuotaPlugin.php.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40709
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40729

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40683
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40690

* Change - Fix permission bits when enforcing passwords on public links: [#40701](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40701)

   It was not possible to enforce passwords on public link files with read + write
   permission. The admin can now check 'Enforce password protection for read +
   write + delete links' to do so.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/40699
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40701

* Change - Do not auto-enable user-key encryption: [#40702](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40702)

* Bugfix - Bump bower_components/clipboard from v2.0.6 to v2.0.11 in /build: [#40064](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40064)

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40064

* Bugfix - Properly remove file versions from the trashbin: [#40286](https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/40286)

   Previously, restoring or removing a file from inside a folder that was deleted
   (so the folder and the contents are in the trashbin) didn't remove the versions
   of the file. Those versions were left in both the DB and the FS, taking space
   and degrading the performance.

   This is now being handled properly, so no additional resource is consumed due to
   the versions being left stranded.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/40286

* Bugfix - Adjust installation database details: [#40348](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40348)

   The suggested host name and port syntax for the database host on the
   installation has been corrected.

* Bugfix - "available for" in the mount point configuration will show displaynames: [#40412](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40412)

   The "available for" select of the mount configuration of external storages were
   using the group id. This wasn't a problem because for local groups the group id
   matches the group displayname, and for ldap groups the group id was the "cn"
   attribute. Due to recent changes, the ldap group will now use the objectuid
   attribute (or a similar attribute) as group id by default. This was causing the
   "available for" select to show that objectuid, so identifying the right group
   was problematic.

   Now, the "available for" select will show the group displayname, which for ldap
   is the "cn" attribute by default.

   Note that this happens on new installations. There is an automatic migration in
   place, so for upgrades, the "cn" attribute will be set as groupname in order to
   keep the old behavior

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40412

* Bugfix - Skip public links when updating permissions of share's children: [#40420](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40420)

   Currently, updates to permissions of a share are wrongly propagated to public
   links children. This has now been fixed and public links are being skipped.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40420

* Bugfix - Add shib auth support for redirect url: [#40470](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40470)

   Without this change, server-side Apache Auth (e.g. Shibboleth) resulted in
   redirect to default owncloud page, instead of last visited page. We now
   correctly handle redirect_url.

* Bugfix - Remove empty directories from the files_versions: [#40499](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40499)

   Empty directories were left when the contained versions were deleted or moved.
   Large installations might end up with too many of these empty directories.

   Now, when a version is deleted, the containing directory will also be deleted if
   there aren't any more versions inside.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40499

* Bugfix - Store checksums only if the whole stream has been read: [#40513](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40513)

   Previously, range downloads (or downloads requesting a specific byte range)
   would store a checksum, if needed, based only on the requested range. This
   causes problems because the checksum is expected to be for the whole file.

   Now, those range downloads won't store a checksum because only a part of the
   file has been read, so the checksum would be incomplete.

   Some additional cases have been taken into account, mostly based on actions that
   could happen on the data stream, but they shouldn't happen normally.

* Bugfix - Performance fix when deleting thumbnails: [#40514](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40514)

   Detecting unused thumbnails is now using a better optimized SQL statements which
   consumes less database and web server resources.

* Bugfix - Prevent creation of empty files/folders when no available quota: [#40567](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40567)

   Until now it was possible for users having 0 quota or who already reached the
   limit of their assigned quota to still create empty files/folders, which
   generates confusion. The PR fixes this behaviour.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40568

* Bugfix - Fix the dav:cleanup-chunks command to work with a configured folder: [#40571](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40571)

   The ownCloud's FS was initialized partially to prevent contacting the LDAP
   server if it was configured. This was causing problems because the upload folder
   where the chunks were expected was a mountpoint, and due to the partial FS
   initialization such mountpoint was missing, so we were checking a different
   folder (the default one).

   Now, the ownCloud's FS will be fully initialized instead, so the mountpoint will
   be present and we check the right location.

* Bugfix - Bump bower_components/showdown from 2.0.0 to 2.1.0 in /build: [#40579](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40579)

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40579

* Bugfix - Fix orientation of images with exif data: [#40600](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40600)

   Some images with a large exif data had problems with the orientation when they
   were shown. This was caused by the native function failing to retrieve the exif
   data. Images with small exif data didn't have this problem.

   By making the chunk size of the stream bigger, the native function is able to
   load the exif data properly and return the information, and with such
   information we can fix the orientation of the image.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40600

* Bugfix - Fix header title and claim rendered as escaped HTML: [#40605](https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/40605)

   The files_sharing application template was escaping the HTML from the title and
   claim provided by the theme. This caused raw HTML to be displayed in the page
   header.

* Bugfix - Use correct themed l10n app folder when app lives outside of server root: [#40607](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40607)

   When an app_path is pointing outside of the ownCloud server root or uses an
   symlink under certain conditions the l10n folder points to an invalid location
   and results in a crash of the server. This happened due to the assumption that
   app paths always start with the server root path.

* Bugfix - Fix share into share move scenario: [#40612](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40612)

   Public links were lost upon moving share into another share as the share owner
   was not correctly set. This has been now partially fixed.

* Bugfix - Adjust request body options for Guzzle7: [#40652](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40652)

   In Guzzle major version 7 the body option of a request must be a string or
   similar. Requests that send arrays of items have been adjusted to use the
   form_params option. Developers of apps that use
   lib/private/Http/Client/IClient.php should check any calls to ensure that arrays
   of items are not passed in the body option. See the diffs of PHP docs in the
   linked PR for examples.

* Change - Allow specifying available space for objectstorages: [#40389](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40389)

   Objectstorages are reporting only unknown storage space. This causes problems in
   other apps that rely on this storage method, e.g. metrics app that monitors
   available space. Now, new configuration in the storage level is added, allowing
   for using the system configuration variable by the apps or further extension of
   storage class for objectstorage.

* Change - Drop PHP 7.3 support across the platform: [#40394](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40394)

   Support for security fixes for PHP 7.3 ended in Dec 2021 ownCloud core no longer
   supports PHP 7.3. Ensure that you are using PHP 7.4.

* Change - Test indirect resource existence: [#40406](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40406)

   We now expect a not found error instead of permission denied error for some
   trash interactions.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40406

* Change - Detect mime types of hidden files: [#40427](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40427)

   Mime type of hidden files are now properly detected.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40427

* Change - Copy the encryption keys first and then rename the files: [#40433](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40433)

   Having encryption enabled, when a file was renamed, first the actual file was
   renamed, and then the encryption keys were moved to the new location. If
   something went wrong, it was possible that the keys weren't moved. This caused
   the file to become inaccessible because we couldn't decrypt the file due to the
   missing keys (which weren't in the right place)

   Now, when a file is renamed, the encryption keys will be copied first, and then
   the file will be renamed. If the encryption keys fail to be copied, the rename
   will fail. After the encryption keys are copied, the file could failed to be
   renamed. In this case, the copied keys will be removed, but the file will still
   be accessible because we still keep the old keys. The original keys (not the
   copy) will be removed if the file is renamed successfully.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40433

* Change - Drop unneeded Google SDK services: [#40444](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40444)

   Unused Google SDK services are removed to reduce package size.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40444

* Change - Delete action is removed from sharing sections: [#40497](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40497)

   In the files apps, the "shared with others" and "shared by link" sections
   allowed people to use a delete action on a file or folder present in that list.
   This was causing problems because people accidentally removed the folder when,
   in fact, they wanted to unshare it.

   This delete action isn't present any longer. You can unshare from those views by
   accessing the file or folder's details. If you want to delete the file or
   folder, you can do it from the regular "all files" section.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40497

* Change - Allow to temporarily ignore invalid federated shares: [#40503](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40503)

   This change is targeted mostly at tightly federated setups

   Currently, if federated share is invalid or api endpoint returns not found,
   availability check would validate whether this is a problem with a server and if
   checks complete that given share is removed. However, in some cases these checks
   might not be enough (e.g. complex migrations in tightly federated setups), and
   in that case invalidation behaviour can be disabled using below app setting:

   Files_sharing.enable_cleanup_invalid_external_shares='no'

* Enhancement - Show username on personal profile page: [#40510](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40510)

   The username as well as the full name of a user is now shown on their personal
   general settings page.

* Enhancement - Add legal privacy policy and imprint links to personal settings: [#40511](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40511)

   The links for legal.privacy_policy_url and legal.imprint_url are now displayed
   on the personal general settings page so that they are conveniently available
   for all users to see. These are only displayed if they are set.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40511

* Enhancement - Persistent major file version workflow: [#40531](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40531)

   - Restore operation logic changed. Now restore is creating new current version
   of the file from one of past noncurrent versions of the file. Current version
   also receives incremented mtime for the file, and author of the files is the
   user that restored the file. The old noncurrent version is no longer removed
   upon restore and current version no longer receives mtime of the version. - The
   current version of the file is now shown in the Versions Tab, highlighted with
   "gray" background - Versions now persist additional extended metadata on
   versioning tags, that allow easier identification of the versions. Each update
   increases minor version for the file. Current version of the file now can be
   published, which increases major version tag. - Each new edit of the file would
   create noncurrent versions. The ones tagged with major version due to
   publishing, will be persisted long term and wont be subject to any retention
   policies. - Migrate from deprecated save_version_author to save_version_metadata

* Enhancement - Add support for login policies: [#40574](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40574)

   Support for login policies has been added in order to block the login of users
   under some circumstances. By default, there isn't any restriction, so any user
   can login normally (assuming the password is correct)

   A group login policy has been added. This policy allows or denies the user from
   login based on the login type being used by the user (username + password,
   openidconnect, etc) and whether he belongs to specific groups. This can be used
   to ensure a group of users are always authenticated using a determined
   authentication mechanism.

* Enhancement - Add support for OCM via ScienceMesh: [#40577](https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/40577)

   We've added an if-statement in the files_sharing ShareesController code that
   searches for remote sharees. When the config entry `sharing.remoteShareesSearch`
   is set to the name of a class that is registered in the server container and
   that implements `IRemoteShareesSearch`, for instance the
   'ScienceMeshSearchPlugin' that the 'sciencemesh' app registers, use it instead
   of the federatedfilesharing app to find sharee matches for OCM sharing.

* Enhancement - Drag & Drop folders into public file upload: [#40643](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40643)

   Previously only files were accepted via drag & drop. Users can now also drag
   folders into a public link that has the filedrop flag. When adding a folder, the
   hierarchy is flattened out and all files are added without any subfolders. Name
   collisons are avoided as usual.

* Enhancement - Make sender display name in mail notifications configurable: [#40671](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40671)

   In some cases mail notifications related to sharing activities are blocked by
   mail filters as they are flagged as email impersonation. In such cases it may be
   desirable for an oC admin to have a config option for removing the sender
   display name from the "From" address. This is now possible by setting the
   following config.php parameter:

   Remove_sender_display_name => true

## Details

* Bugfix - Trigger the right event when the filecache is updated: [#39844](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39844)

   When the filecache was being updated, an "addToCache" event was triggered. The
   event has been changed to an "updateCache" event

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39844

* Bugfix - Replace userid with username in login form: [#39870](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39870)

   The login form now replaces a user id with the user name.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39870
   https://github.com/owncloud/oauth2/pull/286

* Bugfix - List apps only once: [#39930](https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/39930)

   `occ app:list --minimal` could display apps twice in the listing. Each app is
   now displayed only once.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/39930
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40081

* Bugfix - Do not crash while running the cleanup-chunks command: [#40000](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40000)

   Previously, when you run the cleanup-chunks command, any unhandled exception
   could crash the command. If this happened, there could be chunks that weren't
   deleted.

   Now, the command runs through all the chunks. If some chunks give problems, a
   message is displayed indicating what error happened in which file.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40000

* Bugfix - Get file size using cURL on Ubuntu 20.04 and 22.04: [#40065](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40065)

   Local file size using the php-curl functions did not work on Ubuntu 20.04 or
   22.04. The code has been enhanced so that the file size can be determined using
   php-curl on these operating system releases.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40065

* Bugfix - Filter sensitive data in log for Session::createSessionToken: [#40066](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40066)

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40066

* Bugfix - Correct Executed Unavailable Migrations and New Migrations: [#40084](https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/40084)

   `occ migrations:status` was reporting an incorrect value for these items. The
   problem has been corrected.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/40084
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40085

* Bugfix - Ensure user's directory is always present: [#40091](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40091)

   There are some scenarios where the user's directory might not be created. This
   leads to a state where the user can't upload any file, so the admin might need
   to remove the account and create a new one.

   While this scenario might still happen, we're now ensuring that the user's
   directory is created at some point, so the user can upload files into his
   account at any time.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40091

* Bugfix - Allow usernames to be case-insensitive with app passwords: [#40119](https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/40119)

   When using an app password, the associated username can now be provided in any
   case-insensitive way in requests. Username "Alice" and "alice" will work the
   same.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/40119
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40281

* Bugfix - Quota can be exceeded by user: [#40140](https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/40140)

   Copying a file in or out of a received share could succeed even if there was not
   enough storage quota allowed at the target location. This problem has been
   fixed. Copies will now return 507 "Insufficient storage" in this case.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/40140
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39895

* Bugfix - Application selection menu now appears on shared folders: [#40143](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40143)

   An app selection menu will appear on public folder links when you click in a
   file that could be opened with multiple apps. The behavior is the same as in the
   regular file listing.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40143

* Bugfix - Do not invalidate app tokens when no LDAP connection: [#40152](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40152)

   Whenever connection to the LDAP server became unavailable app tokens were
   getting deleted after some time causing disconnection of connected clients. App
   tokens are now remaining valid until connection is back.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40152

* Bugfix - Convert from utf8_encode to mb_convert_encoding: [#40158](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40158)

   Function `utf8_encode` will be deprecated and removed in future PHP versions. It
   has been replaced with function mb_convert_encoding.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40158

* Bugfix - Apps requiring SAML/SSO session now load correctly at first page: [#40161](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40161)

   Apps that require session to load some content at request start, could not be
   loaded due to missing SAML/SSO session objects that could only be obtained after
   the app loaded or at next visited page when that object was correctly persisted.
   Now, after handling apache backend session, auth success confirmation page is
   shown that redirects to the owncloud landing page.

   https://github.com/owncloud/enterprise/issues/4712
   https://github.com/owncloud/enterprise/issues/5225
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/31052
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40161

* Bugfix - Display error message when a group cannot be created: [#40162](https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/40162)

   If a new group could not be created on the user-management UI, the error message
   text was not displayed. This problem has been fixed.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/40162
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40163

* Bugfix - Error responses to add group API requests are inconsistent: [#40164](https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/40164)

   Some response error messages were contained in a `data` structure. Others were
   not. They have now been made consistent. They are not contained in a `data`
   structure.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/40164
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40165

* Bugfix - Handle exception when adding mount to existing cache or lock: [#40192](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40192)

   In some cases there are can be multiple parallel requests that could in their
   logic attempt to create shared file mountpoint for the file or to create lock,
   e.g. collaboration software. Exception to add cache or lock that already exists
   is now handled

   https://github.com/owncloud/enterprise/issues/5198
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40192

* Bugfix - CORS on WebDAV is not working: [#40204](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40204)

   The list of allowed domains was not being correctly decoded, resulting in
   failure to recognise a valid domain, and thus failure to send the relevant CORS
   headers. The decoding of the domains list has been corrected.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/40203
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40204

* Bugfix - Handle extra slashes at start of URI path: [#40216](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40216)

   If extra slashes were present in a request URI before the path then a 500 server
   error was returned. For example, https://example.com//remote.php/webdav/file.txt

   Any extra slashes are now removed and the request works.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/34365
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40216

* Bugfix - Use group's displayname in the user's profile and user list: [#40229](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40229)

   Previously, the group id was being used in both the user's profile and the user
   list. This hasn't been important because the local groups have matching group id
   and displayname, the same for ldap groups.

   Due to recent changes with the ldap app (version 0.17.0), the group id and the
   displayname could be different, and they'll be different by default in the ldap
   app.

   In both the user's profile and the user list, the group id was being used
   instead of the displayname. This is fixed now, and the displayname will be used
   as intended.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40229

* Bugfix - Init encryption module before calculating unencrypted block-size: [#40240](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40240)

   The un-encrypted blocksize was calculated before initializing the encryption-
   module. This yields the wrong size after a file-scan if
   encryption.use_legacy_encoding is set to true in config.php.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40240

* Bugfix - Fix personal settings display for apps which are not whitelisted: [#40257](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40257)

   Apps can be disabled or enabled for guests. The personal settings for disabled
   apps were still being shown to guest users. This problem has been fixed. Only
   the settings for enabled apps are displayed now.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40257

* Bugfix - Only call getGroupDetails when the group exists: [#40261](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40261)

   When getting a group, the getGroupDetails method could be called for a group
   that does not exist. That is unnecessary and may cause a group backend
   implementation to log an error. The code has been refactored to avoid this
   happening.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40261

* Bugfix - Refactor to not have required params following an optional parameter: [#40303](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40303)

   All required parameters should be listed first in PHP functions. Adjust the code
   to meet this rule.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40303

* Bugfix - Prevent expiry for version meta data files: [#40325](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40325)

   Version meta data files now get ignored during the expiry process. This fixes
   the massive amount of error logs being produced during this.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40325

* Change - Update PHP dependencies: [#39368](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39368)

* Change - Improve visualization of author's comment in the comments section: [#40142](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40142)

   Previously, a long display name for the author's comment could overlap with the
   "edit" action and the date. Worst case, the comment might not be edited because
   the "edit" action was below the author's display name, so you might not be able
   to click the action.

   Right now, the author's display name won't overlap with the rest of the
   elements. The display name will be cut if needed, but both the "edit" action and
   the date will be clearly visible.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40142

* Enhancement - Add default app setting on a user basis: [#39600](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39600)

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39600

* Enhancement - Ignore thumbnails when propagating in home: [#39988](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39988)

   We no longer needlessly propagate the etag and mtime for thumbnails in the
   filecache.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39988

* Enhancement - Add language prop to /cloud/user and /cloud/users/{userid} endpoint: [#40087](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40087)

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40087

* Enhancement - Add additional columns to background job queue status: [#40113](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40113)

   Command `occ background:queue:status` now shows additional columns for: - Last
   Checked - Reserved At - Execution Duration

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40113

* Enhancement - Add config option to bypass the proxy setting by domain: [#40148](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40148)

   The new "proxy_ignore" option allows the admin to set a list of domains that
   won't go through the proxy set via the "proxy" option

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40148

* Enhancement - Allow sharing with multiple users at once: [#40155](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40155)

   It is now possible to share resources with multiple users at once via the
   following format: user1, user2, user3.

* Enhancement - Allow editing of public link shared single files: [#40264](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40264)

   It is now possible to create a public link share of a single file with
   Download/View/Edit permissions.

* Bugfix - Don't resend invitation mail if a user is guest: [#39602](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39602)

   With this change the resend invitation mail action in the user management UI for
   guest users has been removed, it is not appropriate for this type of user.

* Bugfix - Text previews had faulty content if BOM was present: [#39669](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39669)

   The BOM was incorrectly detected and was causing ownCloud to choose the wrong
   font for the text, showing unexpected results. The BOM is now processed
   correctly and the preview is shown as expected

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39669

* Bugfix - Fix files:checksums:verify for a single file: [#39683](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39683)

   Fixed an issue where running files:checksums:verify for a single file would
   fail.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39683

* Bugfix - Moving a file from one folder into a folder that is a number fails: [#39702](https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/39702)

   The issue is fixed by updating sabre/dav from 4.3.0 to 4.3.1

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/39702
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39703

* Bugfix - Make licenses expire at the end of the expiration date: [#39735](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39735)

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39735

* Bugfix - Subadmin will be shown only his assignable groups in the users page: [#39752](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39752)

   Previously, the subadmin could see all groups even if he could only assign users
   to a bunch of them. Now the subadmin will see the groups he can assign to the
   user

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39752

* Bugfix - Fix wrong formatted XML in public-files dav endpoint: [#39797](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39797)

   Previously, trying to perform a PROPFIND over the public-files endpoint could
   cause an exception to be thrown, which would generate a wrong formatted XML
   response. Now, the XML response is properly formatted and can be parsed without
   problems.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39797

* Bugfix - Fix issue restoring versions from the trashbin after sharing: [#39822](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39822)

   Previously, having encryption enabled, if a user shared a folder with another
   user, and that new user removed a file inside that shared folder, that file
   ended up in the new user's trashbin along with the file's versions. Restoring
   that file from the trashbin caused the versions of that file to get broken due
   to a bad signature. The file was restored correctly. Now, the versions are also
   restored correctly from the trashbin too.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39822

* Bugfix - Fix issue when encryption is enabled and a file is moved out of the share: [#39829](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39829)

   When encryption was used, moving a file out of a shared folder caused the
   versions of the file to get broken. The file was moved correctly though. This
   happened due to the key file not being copied to the new location and a new key
   file being generated for the file. Now, the key file is properly copied to the
   new location, so the versions can be decrypted properly.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39829

* Bugfix - Avoid sending unneeded passwords in the files_external app: [#39841](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39841)

   Some passwords were being sent to the web UI in the external storage
   configuration. These passwords aren't required and they're now replaced in the
   web UI in order not to leak the actual password

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39841

* Bugfix - Fix issue with requesting an invalid share id: [#39868](https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/39868)

   When using the pgsql database and requesting an invalid share id, a 500 error
   status could be returned. This has been fixed. A 404 "not found" is now
   returned.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39873

* Bugfix - Remove fr_FR language variant: [#39931](https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/39931)

   French translations were in both the "fr" and the "fr_FR" language codes.
   "fr_FR" had very few translations and could cause missing translations when the
   system did not automatically choose "fr". The "fr_FR" translations have been
   removed. Translators should use "fr" when doing translations in Transifex.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/39931
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39939

* Bugfix - Limit the width of the form on login page: [#39962](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39962)

   The login form breaks if error messages and info messages are longer.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39962

* Bugfix - Allow re-uploading the same folder after being renamed: [#39966](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39966)

   Previously, you couldn't upload a folder, rename it in the web UI and then
   re-upload the same folder.

   This behavior is fixed, so you can now re-upload the folder after renaming it

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39966

* Bugfix - Default for propfind depth infinity adjusted: [#40016](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40016)

   Fixed potential cause for performance issues under certain conditions with
   infinite propfind being enabled by default.

   https://github.com/owncloud/enterprise/issues/5154
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40016

* Bugfix - Allow partial initialization of the FS: [#40031](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40031)

   Previously, when the FS was initialized, we needed to make a request to the LDAP
   server in order to fetch the possible group shares of the user. Some commands
   only accessed to the trashbin or versions, and operated for a target user, so
   accessing to the LDAP server to fetch groups that wouldn't be used doesn't make
   much sense.

   Now, the commands have the ability to initialize the FS partially, meaning that
   no additional mount point other than the home one will be mounted. In
   particular, this affects shares and external storages. Anyway, the commands that
   have been modified don't need such access. The main advantage is that now, those
   commands can operate without a working connection to the LDAP server because the
   users will be fetched from the DB and they don't operate with groups.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40031

* Bugfix - Filter sensitive data in log for Session::createSessionToken: [#40066](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40066)

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40066

* Change - Update the default poll-interval in capabilities: [#39143](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39143)

* Change - Private keys for SFTP storage will be stored in credentials table: [#39935](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39935)

   Previously, both private and public keys were part of the configuration of the
   SFTP mount point. Although encrypted, there were some scenarios where the
   private key could be visible.

   The following changes have been implemented: * The private key will never leave
   the ownCloud server. * The private key will be stored encrypted inside the
   oc_credentials table. * A random token will be created to refer to the private
   key. This token will be part of the SFTP mount point configuration. * The public
   key will be treated as a normal configuration parameter. This means that it
   won't be neither encrypted nor encoded in any way.

   The overall behavior remains the same. ownCloud will generate a key pair, whose
   public key will need to be placed in the SFTP server.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39935

* Enhancement - Allow OPTIONS request handling in framework controllers: [#38758](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38758)

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38758

* Enhancement - Unify API responses when setting permissions for public links: [#39194](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39194)

   Setting (and changing) the permissions of public links via the OCS API will now
   return proper and unified API responses. Adding create permissions while public
   uploading is disabled globally will always return a 403 response.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/36443
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39194

* Enhancement - Show detailed error message if moving a mount into another fails: [#39584](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39584)

   With this change, a detailed error message is shown when moving a mount point
   into another mount point fails. This is for example the case while moving a
   shared folder into a SFTP external storage.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/39550
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39584

* Enhancement - Add warnings for commands that are incompatible with object storage: [#39604](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39604)

   The following commands are affected:

   * `user:home:list-users` * `user:home:list-dirs` * `user:move` * `user:report`

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/39590
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39604

* Enhancement - Cache some data in memory from the filecache: [#39847](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39847)

   Some data from the filecache will be cached from the DB after accessing. This
   will improve the performance a bit.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39847

* Enhancement - Add product to version in capabilities response: [#39851](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39851)

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39851

* Enhancement - Allow files_external app to be disabled: [#39856](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39856)

   Previously, the files_external app couldn't be disabled. The corresponding
   section in the settings page had a checkbox to show or not the settings for the
   files_external app. Now, if the app is disabled, that section won't appear. The
   behavior will be the same as any other disabled app.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39856

* Enhancement - Improve FileDrop view: [#39900](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39900)

   Small change in the design and behavior of the FileDrop view of Public Links.

   - The font is bigger and thicker - Background color was added to the list of
   files - The text in the "Dropbox" is wrapped properly, line-height was removed -
   Don't hide the logo on small resolutions

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39900

* Enhancement - Align "close" for messages: [#39907](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39907)

   The close button for messages (yellow banner) was slightly displaced.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39907

* Enhancement - Changes regarding cookie handling: [#39916](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39916)

   The following changes have been implemented: * The expiration set for the
   passphrase cookie will be refreshed each time a page is loaded or when the
   "heartbeat" endpoint is hit * If the "session_keepalive" config option is set to
   true, a periodic request to the "heartbeat" endpoint will be made automatically
   regardless of any activity going on. This will extend the session lifetime
   preventing its expiration. * If the "session_keepalive" config option is set to
   false, a "heartbeat" will be sent based on activity in order to extend the
   session lifetime. If we don't detect any activity, the session might expire, and
   the user will need to login again. * The new "session_forced_logout_timeout"
   option has been added to the config.php. It's disabled by default, and setting a
   positive (non-zero) value will enable the feature. If it's enabled, the
   passphrase cookie will expire after those number of seconds pass, when the tab
   or the browser closes. This will force the user to login again.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39916

* Enhancement - Expose user type of share receiver in share api: [#40013](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40013)

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40013

* Enhancement - Use the same string in the header also in public view: [#40032](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40032)

   In the public view, a different string was used next to the logo than in the
   internal header. This can cause problems with branding.

   The string HTMLName from defaults.php is now only used for the header. Name is
   used exclusively for the mail templates.

## Details

* Security - Patch jquery ui: [#39451](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39451)

   Patched jquery ui issues:

   * CVE-2021-41182 * CVE-2021-41183 * CVE-2021-41184

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39451

* Security - Patch jquery ui CVE-2016-7103: [#39545](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39545)

   Patched a CVE regarding the jquery dialog widget. This widget is currently not
   being used so this is a preventive patch.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39545

* Bugfix - Do not try to login via auth module if the user is disabled: [#36257](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/36257)

   Trying to login via an auth module (such as OAuth2) created a new session token
   even if the user was disabled. This was causing errors to appear in the logs
   because the new session token created after enabling the user was in use. Now, a
   disabled user won't create that session token.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/36257

* Bugfix - Don't show exact search results with empty sharee search query: [#38501](https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/38501)

   When setting user.search_min_length to 0 and using an empty query to search for
   sharees, there won't be any exact search results.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/38501
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39186

* Bugfix - Do not allow empty system or app config keys: [#38996](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38996)

   It was possible to add empty config keys with the occ config:app:set or
   config:system:set commands. That is no longer allowed.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38996

* Bugfix - Allow subadministrators to add users to groups they manage: [#39013](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39013)

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39013

* Bugfix - Update and upgrade words are inconsistent on the web UI: [#39028](https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/39028)

   The words about "upgrade needed" on the web UI sometimes used "update". The
   upgrade messages now consistently use the word "upgrade", which matches with the
   occ upgrade command.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/39028
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39032

* Bugfix - Avoid potential open_basedir errors after upgrade to PHP 7.4.21: [#39034](https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/39034)

   PHP 7.4.21 checks open_basedir settings more exactly. Calls to file_exists can
   emit log messages like "file_exists(): open_basedir restriction in effect" that
   were not emitted by PHP 7.4.20.

   This change fixes an incorrect file_exists check. The open_basedir message will
   no longer be emitted in this case.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39035

* Bugfix - Allow copying file keys when storage has multiple mount points: [#39058](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39058)

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39058

* Bugfix - Show previews in profile picture setting, select from files: [#39067](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39067)

   Before this PR, image previews was not shown anymore in
   Settings->Personal->Profile picture->Select from Files, as well the UI was
   cropped. This has been fixed with this PR.

   https://github.com/owncloud/enterprise/issues/4689
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39067

* Bugfix - Do not try to delete the folder twice: [#39070](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39070)

   Previously, when a folder was moved to the trashbin from an external storage,
   the usual action was to copy the contents to the trashbin and then remove them
   from the source, and additionally another remove operation on the source was
   triggered. This second delete request was performed but the result was ignored,
   and the storages didn't log anything.

   With this change, this second delete request won't happen. The behaviour is
   still the same: copy to the trashbin and then remove from the source.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39070

* Bugfix - Close open menus if click is on an iFrame: [#39093](https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/39093)

   Before this PR click events was caught by iFrames due to this circumstances for
   example the settings menu was never closed while clicking inside the
   files_pdfviewer viewer. With this PR a new event has been added and closes the
   menu.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39094

* Bugfix - Prevent unneeded call to LDAP during login with local users: [#39105](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39105)

   Previously, when the user_ldap app was enabled, any login with a local user
   would check the LDAP server for that user even though it shouldn't be needed.

   Now, such call won't happen if it has been handled by a different component. In
   particular, login with a local user won't trigger that request to LDAP.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39105
   https://github.com/owncloud/user_ldap/pull/675

* Bugfix - Clarify the description of the manual file locking option: [#39106](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39106)

   The administrator can enable manual file locking in the admin settings. That
   enables manual file locking on the web interface, not on all clients. The text
   has been changed to describe this correctly.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39106

* Bugfix - Update appinfo cache only if the app version is newer: [#39108](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39108)

   Previously, in case there were multiple copies of the same app with different
   versions, the information being cached was the latest one found based on the
   locations defined in the config.php file, which might not be the one from the
   latest app version. This might be a problem in some scenarios specially checking
   the version of the app. Note that the code used was the one from the latest app
   version found.

   Now, the information cached is always from the latest version found. In the
   weird case that both versions are the same, the information from the first one
   will be kept. This shouldn't be a problem because the information is expected to
   be the same.

* Bugfix - Fix logo size on login screen: [#39129](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39129)

   The previous fixed logo size resulted in a cut off logo in some cases. This was
   fixed by using a dynamically logo resize css rule.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39129

* Bugfix - Image orientation: [#39140](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39140)

   vertically - Use correct HTML elements (div instead of span)

* Bugfix - Keep pagination active with empty search queries: [#39155](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39155)

   Before this fix, an empty search string would pre-render all rows in the file
   list, ignoring the pagination. This fix ensures that the file list is paginated
   correctly in combination with an empty search query.

* Bugfix - File conflict dialog when dragging a file into a folder: [#39162](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39162)

   When dragging a file into a folder, while another file with an identical name
   exists in the parent directory, the UI falsely showed a conflict dialog alert.
   This has been fixed.

* Bugfix - Set file name to download.zip while downloading the whole user directory: [#39198](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39198)

   Before this PR, selecting all files and folders in the webUI and clicking the
   download button, resulted in a file downloaded with the name ".zip". With this
   PR the file name is now "download.zip".

   changed.

* Bugfix - Don't count non-user folder in occ user:report command: [#39223](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39223)

   Before this PR several folders, for example 'avatars', have been counted as user
   folders via the occ user:report command. With this PR a list of folders has been
   added which should not be counted as user folders. The user directory count is
   now correct.

* Bugfix - Command occ 'user:report' might not count 'user directories' correctly: [#39254](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39254)

   Before this PR the underlying function of 'user:report' just looked up in the
   'datadirectory' set in 'config.php'. This implies that user directories which
   are symlinks or even not in the 'datadirectory', have not been taken into
   account. With this PR we check if the user's home path exists and increase the
   'user directories' count.

* Bugfix - Decouple change email from 'allow_user_to_change_display_name' setting: [#39288](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39288)

   Before this change, with setting 'allow_user_to_change_display_name' false, the
   user was not able to change the mail address in Settings->Personal->General via
   the webUI.

   With this change, the setting 'allow_user_to_change_mail_address' has been
   introduced and change mail address has been decoupled from setting
   `allow_user_to_change_display_name`.

   'allow_user_to_change_mail_address' must be set explicitly to false, to take
   effect.

   this is more consistent now.

   Before this change toggle between 'Set password for new users' option, may
   preserve and send unwanted password or email information. This has been fixed,
   the webUI will not send email data to the server if the option 'Set password for
   new users' is active, vice versa password won't be sent if the option is
   disabled.

   With this change, we allow renaming a file to an existing file name, when the
   path differs. This happens for example when the user creates the file
   '/mydirname/text.txt' and '/mytext.txt' then marks both as favorite, and then
   navigates to the Favorites and renames 'mytext.txt' to 'text.txt'

   `allow_user_to_change_display_name` are set to `false`, changing the
   corresponding values via the provisioning API is no longer possible.

* Bugfix - Clicking in the middle of the row in the file list downloads the file: [#39361](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39361)

   This change addresses the issue if the user clicks in on a row in the file list,
   the file gets downloaded or open with the default viewer. This was not intended,
   the download or default opening should only happen if the user clicks directly
   on the file name. Problems with mobile devices, where the file name was too long
   to display, has been also solved.

* Bugfix - Load l10n js files from the correct app folder: [#39482](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39482)

   With this PR, we ensure that the translations will be loaded from the correct
   app folder path. For example, if you have two versions of an app, where one
   version is in the apps folder and the other one in the apps-external folder. The
   change also ensures that theme translations will be loaded additionally instead
   of replacing the whole app translations. This has the advantage that the user
   can cherry-pick single words to translate.

   This change allows a mime type to have multiple default file actions. In the

   Shares from one ownCloud to another ownCloud were referred to in some places as
   remote shares and in other places as federated shares. References to remote
   shares in error messages and on the user interface have been changed to
   references to federated shares. All user-facing text now calls these federated
   shares.

* Enhancement - Quick action for creating public links: [#4718](https://github.com/owncloud/enterprise/issues/4718)

   This feature introduces a quick action in the filelist for creating read-only
   public links. It can be enabled via 'sharing.showPublicLinkQuickAction' in the
   config.php.

* Enhancement - Special user groups can break persistent locks: [#38222](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38222)

   Not only the owner of a lock can unlock a resource but the lock breaker groups
   are allowed to break locks as well.

* Enhancement - Allow oc_sessionPassphrase cookie to expire with session_lifetime: [#38991](https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/38991)

   Before this PR the session cookie oc_sessionPassphrase has expiration time 0
   regardless of the value of `session_lifetime` in config.php

   Now the behavior will be that after setting `session_lifetime` in config.php
   will make oc_sessionPassphrase cookie to expire in that period of time
   invalidating the current session and forcing a log out. In the other hand, if
   session_lifetime is not defined or 0, oc_sessionPassphrase will assume its
   original value before this PR of 0.

* Enhancement - Log number of mounts when moving encryption keys fails: [#39015](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39015)

   Due to wrong configuration or bugs it is possible that more than one mount is
   returned. In this case we should log the mount-count for easier debugging.

* Enhancement - Include new DB index to speed up addressbook searches: [#39017](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39017)

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39017

* Enhancement - Add command to verify all available doc links: [#39026](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39026)

   All available doc links can now be tested and verified via `make
   test-doc-links`. It is also possible to specify the ownCloud version to look for
   in the docs via `make test-doc-links DOC_LINK_VERSION=10.7`. It defaults to the
   ownCloud version of the current installation.

* Enhancement - Show create and cancel buttons in the 'New file menu': [#39056](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39056)

   If the user hits the '+' button in the UI, a context menu will be shown, where
   the user is able to choose for example 'Folder'. A form will show up to set the
   new folder name, the user needs to confirm by hitting the enter key. This might
   not been understood by every user at the first glance. Therefore, with this PR a
   create and cancel button has been added.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39056

* Enhancement - Extend transfer ownership cmd with option to transfer entire user: [#39118](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39118)

   Command occ files:transfer-ownership now includes flag
   --destination-use-user-folder <user-id> that allows to transfer all user files
   and shares to destination user that has never logged in. This is helpful in
   situation when users need to be migrated to new accounts.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39118

* Enhancement - Add console command to move a user's home folder: [#39136](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39136)

   Occ user:move-home <user_id> <new_location>

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39136

* Enhancement - Confirmation dialog for deleting tags: [#39157](https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/39157)

   This feature introduces confirmation dialog while deleting a tag to prevent
   unwanted data-loss

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/39157
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39158

* Enhancement - Display clickable links during web UI upgrade process: [#39184](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39184)

   Before this PR, error messages can contain links that have not been clickable.
   With this PR, links are clickable and open them in a new tab.

* Enhancement - Don't show updater if setting 'upgrade.disable-web' is set to true: [#39185](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39185)

   With this PR the update section in Settings->Admin->General will be not shown if
   setting 'upgrade.disable-web' is set to true.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39185

* Enhancement - Hide accept and decline share text on mobile view: [#39224](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39224)

   Before this PR within the "Shared with you" files list, a text for accept and
   decline was shown next to the associated icon. These texts were using excessive
   space in the mobile view and might leave the "State" column not completely
   visible. This has been fixed with this PR through hiding those unnecessary
   texts.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39224

* Enhancement - Add option to hide the upload estimation in WebUI: [#39228](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39228)

   The upload estimation can now be hidden when setting `hide_upload_estimation` to
   "yes" via occ command: occ config:app:set files hide_upload_estimation
   --value="yes"

   https://github.com/owncloud/enterprise/issues/4743
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39228

* Enhancement - Allow skeletondirectory to be an empty string: [#39230](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39230)

   Skeletondirectory can now be set to an empty string in config.php to indicate
   that no skeleton is required.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39230

* Enhancement - Improve mobile view for "Shared by link" file list: [#39232](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39232)

   With this PR, the "Expiration date" column won't be displayed in mobile view
   anymore to gather space.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39232

* Enhancement - Use icons + buttons instead of text for file actions in mobile view: [#39233](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39233)

   Before this PR, as files were selected in the files list, actions was shown with
   icon and text, for example: 'Download' and 'Delete'. This uses much space and UI
   glitches are possible due to limited screen size. With this PR we now show
   buttons with the associated icons without any text.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39233

* Enhancement - Hide restore text in deleted files list on mobile device: [#39236](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39236)

   With this PR restore text next to the associated icon will be hidden to grant
   space for the file and folder names.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39236

* Enhancement - Redesign group list in the user settings view: [#39262](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39262)

   Before this PR, the group list settings were confusing as the user needs to
   click on a group first before the trash bin icon appears to delete a group. As
   well the user count was nondescript. With this PR, a redesign takes care of
   those issues and also fixes the problem that while deleting a group in the group
   list, it was still available in the user group list. Furthermore, after deleting
   a group, the user will be redirected to the 'Everyone' group summary view. Also
   fixes an issue where the 'active'-class on a newly created group was duplicated.

* Enhancement - Previews for text files including non-latin characters: [#39271](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39271)

   Generate and display previews for text files that include non-latin characters
   like Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Arabic.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39271

* Enhancement - Allow empty folder uploads via webUI: [#39285](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39285)

   Before this change, drag and drop of an empty folder did not work, there was no
   response in the webUI. While uploading a folder with a text file and an empty
   folder, the folder with the text file was created but the empty folder wasn't.

   These empty folder upload scenarios work now.

* Enhancement - Add support for MariaDB 10.6: [#39286](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39286)

   With this change support for MariaDB 10.6 has been added. If it is a fresh
   ownCloud installation, MariaDB 10.6 can be used right away. For upgrading from
   an older version the command 'occ db:restore-default-row-format' has been
   introduced to remove the deprecated row_format 'compressed' from the ownCloud
   database tables and set it to the default value.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/39283
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39286

* Enhancement - Optimized preview for text files: [#39296](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39296)

   Previews for text files are generated a bit faster. The preview will be
   generated based on the first 2 KB of content. In addition to common Latin
   script, texts using Han, Hiragana, Katakana, Hangul, Devanagari and Arabic
   scripts will also be shown. Note that a text with mixed scripts won't be
   previewed properly.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39296

* Enhancement - Add test receiver mail in Email Settings Admin Panel: [#39297](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39297)

   With this change the admin needs to provide a test receiver mail address while
   sending test mails in the Email Settings Admin Panel. This has the advantage
   that the admin does not need to go back to user settings and set the own mail
   address. The user's own email will be set as preselected value if set.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/33018
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39297

* Enhancement - Change user casing log level to "debug": [#39299](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39299)

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/36139
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39299

* Enhancement - Hide the "Remove Password" button on public links: [#39302](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39302)

   This change hides the "Remove Password" button when editing a public link if a
   password in mandatory.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39302

* Enhancement - Trim spaces while creating, uploading or renaming entities in webUI: [#39310](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39310)

   With this change starting or trailing spaces will be removed while: * Creating
   files and folders in the webUI * Uploading files using the 'Upload' button in
   the webUI * Uploading files and folders using drag & drop in the webUI *
   Renaming files and folders in the webUI

   This also solves problems when the sync client can't sync files and folders with
   trailing spaces based on the underlying file system.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39326

* Enhancement - Add quality setting for JP(E)G preview images: [#39349](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39349)

   A new config setting `previewJPEGImageDisplayQuality` has been introduced with
   which the quality of generated JP(E)G previews can be determined.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39349

* Enhancement - Add last_login to Provisioning API get user response: [#39351](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39351)

   The response to a Provisioning API GET request to the cloud/users/username
   endpoint now includes the last_login time in the response. The value is a Unix
   timestamp in seconds.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39351

* Enhancement - Added needed code for webp thumbnail generation to occur: [#39358](https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/39358)

   Previously thumbnail previews for image files of the webp format with the .webp
   extension were not generated. Instead a generic placeholder icon was shown. This
   enhancement/fix caused the generation of preview thumbnails, just as was
   standard with other image formats.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39360

* Enhancement - Add priority for JavaScript plugins: [#39359](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39359)

   JavaScript plugins can now be registered with a specific priority. A higher
   priority means the plugin will be attached/detached before others.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39367

* Enhancement - Extend occ dav:cleanup-chunks command with local option: [#39394](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39394)

   If an admin runs a setup with multiple servers, connected to the same database
   and sets the configuration for the chunking directory 'dav.chunk_base_dir' to a
   unique place on the server, the command occ dav:cleanup-chunks might fail. This
   happens as the oc_filecache table doesn't give us the information on which
   server the directory is. Therefore the local option has been added to the
   command, with this precondition only files that are on the local filesystem will
   be removed.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39501

* Enhancement - Add user:home:list-dirs and user:home:list-users commands: [#39579](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39579)

   Added two new users commands:

   * `occ user:home:list-dirs` List all homes which are currently used by users *
   `occ user:home:list-users <path>` List all users who have their home in a given
   path * `occ user:home:list-users --all` List all users for every home path

* Bugfix - Expire shares at end of day: [#4324](https://github.com/owncloud/enterprise/issues/4324)

   The Expire Share background job was immediately expiring shares that had an
   expiration date of today. But those shares should continue to work for the rest
   of the day. The behaviour has been corrected. All shares will now work until the
   end of the day that they expire.

* Bugfix - When validating rereshare permission make sure to check parent mountpoint: [#4497](https://github.com/owncloud/enterprise/issues/4497)

   When receiving reshare for a group from parent folder and subfolder of that
   folder with lower permission, further reshares were subject to subfolder reshare
   permissions due to issue with resolving parent mountpoint. With this change we
   now ensure to take parent mountpoint out of received mountpoints

* Bugfix - Use trusted domains to compute the signature of signed urls: [#38465](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38465)

   All configured trusted domains are used when computing the signature of a signed
   url. The server has no real true understanding for which domain the request is
   sent. Especially in proxy scenarios this is a must have.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38465

* Bugfix - Handle exceptions with inaccesible federated share: [#38474](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38474)

   In a scenario federation share storage is inaccessible and returns connection
   timeouts, federated share storage now does not return not found but storage not
   available. Additionaly logging and notifications handling has been improved.

* Bugfix - Fix mispositioned ui elements after leaving viewerMode: [#38547](https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/38547)

   Until today, after leaving the viewer mode (e.G Pdf viewer) the action header
   table in the files list was mispositioned while checking an item. The download
   action and following items went out of sight.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/38547
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38552

* Bugfix - Fix move operation from encrypted storage to unencrypted storage: [#38567](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38567)

   On a move operation from encrypted storage to unencrypted storage, the moved
   file was remaining encrypted. This problem has been fixed.

* Bugfix - Creating self group-reshare should not not share to self: [#38581](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38581)

   In a scenario where resharing with group that user belongs to, permissions and
   attributes were incorrectly handled in share mount logic when permissions for
   that share got adjusted, or that share got again reshared to another user that
   again reshared with prior user. This bugfix prevents creation of self share
   mount in root folder of the user

   https://github.com/owncloud/enterprise/issues/4382
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38581

* Bugfix - Check quota on the necessary move operations: [#38591](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38591)

   When encryption is active, a move operation between two different storages was
   leading to a broken copy on target storage if the target has not enough quota.
   This data loss problem has been resolved.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38591

* Bugfix - Normalize web.baseUrl before using it: [#38600](https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/38600)

   `web.baseUrl` was used for rewriting private and public links to the new web UI
   without normalizing it. This leads to broken authentication if the `web.baseUrl`
   was configured with a trailing slash.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/38600

* Bugfix - Don't rewrite private/public links when web app disabled: [#38602](https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/38602)

   When oc10 app is installed but disabled, we still showed the nav item and
   rewrote the URLs for private and public links.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/38602
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38603

* Bugfix - Objectids for comments and tags are strings: [#38682](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38682)

   We were using integers when asking for some information related to comments and
   tag. This was working fine, but PHP 7.4.18 made some changes in the postgresql
   driver making things more strict. As result, some queries were failing because
   that information was stored as string, not integer.

   This problem is now fixed, and the queries can run without problems.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38682

* Bugfix - Hide sensible information on share download: [#38689](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38689)

   Sensible information could be exposed when downloading a share via public link.
   We now throw a generic exception that overwrites the original exception message.
   Also fixed an error which caused such behavior when appending a null byte to the
   download URL.

   https://github.com/owncloud/enterprise/issues/4536
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38689

* Bugfix - Hide file drop content: [#38691](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38691)

   Requesting file drop share with the deprecated shareinfo API, exposed
   information about the content of the file drop share. We will now deliver empty
   content on the children entry.

   https://github.com/owncloud/enterprise/issues/4540
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38691

* Bugfix - Regenerate session after authenticate a password protected public share: [#38693](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38693)

   Session has been has not been regenerated after authenticate a password
   protected public share. Now we regenerate the session and delete the old one for
   anonymous users.

   https://github.com/owncloud/enterprise/issues/4535
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38693

* Bugfix - Add check when updating the permissions of a federated share: [#38698](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38698)

   This fixes a security issue where a federated share recipient could increase
   permissions on his share. We now limit the permission updates to federated
   re-shares only.

   https://github.com/owncloud/enterprise/issues/4537
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38698

* Bugfix - Prevent renaming or deleting a SMB mount point: [#38709](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38709)

   Renaming or deleting a SMB mount point will throw a 403 error code

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38709

* Bugfix - String to bool conversion in systemtags API: [#38719](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38719)

   String values like "true" and "false" were always converted to true when
   creating a tag via API. We now use filter_var() to fix this behavior.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38719

* Bugfix - Database query filter when getting a tag: [#38725](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38725)

   The filter values for userAssignable and userEditable were swapped, causing a
   wrong result in certain cases.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38725

* Bugfix - Fix federated share download bug happens on some providers: [#38738](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38738)

   Some WebDAV service providers are not able to respond properly when the HTTP
   client request_fulluri option set without proxy. Now, the HTTP client
   request_fulluri option set only if a proxy configured.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38738

* Bugfix - Correctly parse different ocm-provider api responses: [#38751](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38751)

   Some WebDAV service providers returns different responses for ocm-provider API
   and we were not able to parse these responses. This problem has been fixed.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38751

* Bugfix - Move files_antivirus executable mode config options into config.php: [#38753](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38753)

   Executable mode of the files_antivirus app is now configured in the core
   config.php file.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38753
   https://github.com/owncloud/files_antivirus/pull/442

* Bugfix - Delay getting the file info until it's going to be used: [#38767](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38767)

   Some operations require getting the file info to perform the action. Previously,
   this file info was fetched and stored before any operation. In some cases
   fetching the file info triggered a file scan that could delay the whole request
   considerably.

   Now, we fetch the file info only in those operations that require it. There are
   some node operations such as getting the file path that don't require fetching
   the file info, so those operation won't fetch it, and so a potential file scan
   is prevented (for those operations)

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38767

* Bugfix - Image preview for file versions: [#38778](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38778)

   Changed the way how preview thumbnails are being rendered so they will be
   rendered properly for file versions.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/38766
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38778

* Bugfix - Prevent files:checksum:verify from crashing on exception: [#38785](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38785)

   The command now skips files with exceptions instead of crashing. A proper
   message will be displayed to the user who fires the command.

* Bugfix - Include incoming and parent permissions in Share UI subfolder reshares: [#38788](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38788)

   Before this fix SharePanel in Share UI did not include permissions of both
   incoming and parent shares for subfolder reshares. It caused lack of possibility
   of resharing such files/folder even though server-side permissions allowed it.

   https://github.com/owncloud/enterprise/issues/4497
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38788

* Bugfix - Always allow renaming shared mounts: [#38794](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38794)

   We now skip the initial permission check when renaming a shared mount as this
   should always be possible.

* Bugfix - Adjust position of the share autocomplete element: [#38831](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38831)

   We now append the share autocomplete element to #shareTabView to prevent the
   autocomplete dialog from being hidden in certain scenarios. This happened with
   Safari for example as soon as the filelist was long enough to have a vertical
   scrollbar.

   https://github.com/owncloud/enterprise/issues/4603
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38831

* Bugfix - Fix docs link to federated sharing docs: [#38859](https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/38859)

   The link in the share dialogue on the info icon was broken. Was fixed by
   pointing to the correct config value.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38860

* Bugfix - Fix file locks for public shares: [#38922](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38922)

   When using the new WebDAV API, the node which is used to retrieve file locks is
   either of type SharedFile or SharedFolder. Both these types do not implement our
   own node class, so we need to handle them separately. This is needed to properly
   handle file locks on public shares when using the new WebDAV API.

* Change - Update PHP dependencies: [#38524](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38524)

   The following have been updated: - doctrine/cache (1.10.2 to 2.0.3) -
   doctrine/dbal (2.13.1 to 2.13.2) - egulias/email-validator (3.1.0 to 3.1.1) -
   icewind/streams (0.7.3 to 0.7.5) - opis/closure (3.6.1 to 3.6.2) -
   pear/pear_exception (v1.0.1 to v1.0.2) - phpseclib/phpseclib (3.0.6 to 3.0.9) -
   psr/log (1.1.3 to 1.1.4)

   The following have been updated in files_external/3rdparty: - firebase/php-jwt
   (v5.2.1 to v5.3.0) - google/apiclient (v2.9.1 to v2.9.2) -
   google/apiclient-services (v0.164.0 to v0.181.0) - google/auth (v1.15.0 to

* Change - Bump doctrine/dbal from 2.10.4 to 2.13.1: [#38647](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38647)

   Implemented the new method executeStatement in our DB Connection class as
   Doctrine calls this method now instead of the deprecated executeUpdate.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/38681
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38647

* Change - Improve performance for the MOVE operation: [#38649](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38649)

   Previously, in order to move a folder, we needed to get all the content and
   replace the path of each one one by one. Now we replace the path of all the
   content in one DB query, which reduces the network traffic and allows better
   optimization in the DB. This change affects MySQL, MariaDB, Postgresql, and
   Oracle. Sqlite is excluded from this optimization and will use the previous
   behaviour.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38649

* Change - Optimize share rename: [#38656](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38656)

   Renaming a received share could cause a file scan to be triggered. This could
   potentially be a performance problem if the file scan took a while.

   Now, renaming a received share won't trigger that file scan, so the performance
   will be faster.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38656

* Change - All mount configuration items marked as passwords will be encrypted: [#38728](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38728)

   Previously, only some known configuration items were encrypted. This was a
   problem for new items that required protection because this required changes in
   the core product.

   Now, all the items marked as passwords will be encrypted. This will be done
   automatically without 3rd party apps needing to do anything. A migration is also
   provided to update the items if needed.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38728

* Change - Change favicon and color references to match the new CI: [#38750](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38750)

   We changed some color references to match the new CI-color of ownCloud. Also a
   new header image for the mail templates and the ownCloud logo without the "X"
   reference was added.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38750

* Change - Update PHP dependencies: [#38891](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38891)

   The following have been updated: - league/flysystem (1.0.70 => 1.1.4) -
   punic/punic (3.5.1 => 3.6.0) - symfony/service-contracts (v1.1.9 => v2.4.0) -
   symfony/translation-contracts (v1.1.10 => v2.4.0)

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38891

* Change - Update Symfony components: [#38924](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38924)

   The following Symfony components have been updated from 4.4.20 to: - console
   4.4.26 - event-dispatcher 4.4.25 - process 4.4.26 - routing 4.4.25 - translation
   4.4.25

   The following Symfony polyfill components have been updated : -
   symfony/polyfill-ctype (v1.22.1 to v1.23.0) - symfony/polyfill-iconv (v1.22.1 to
   v1.23.0) - symfony/polyfill-intl-idn (v1.22.1 to v1.23.0) -
   symfony/polyfill-intl-normalizer (v1.22.1 to v1.23.0) -

* Change - Update PHP minimum version to 7.2.5: [#38934](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38934)

   The minimum supported PHP version is now 7.2.5. This supports some dependencies
   that require at least 7.2.5.

   PHP 7.2 security patches finished in December 2020. PHP 7.3 security patches
   finish on 6 December 2021. It is recommended that you plan an upgrade to PHP 7.4
   now.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38934

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/38957
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38962

* Enhancement - Command occ user:report shows additional row for guests: [#3467](https://github.com/owncloud/enterprise/issues/3467)

   With this improvement, a new row will be rendered for guest user count on the
   occ user:report command.

   https://github.com/owncloud/enterprise/issues/3467
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38742

* Enhancement - Improve public share federation user interface: [#4393](https://github.com/owncloud/enterprise/issues/4393)

   This adjustment provides a new way to add a public share to ownCloud. A new
   button will be displayed where you can easily add the share to the current
   server without entering the string, this requires less user input. Next to this
   button, a dropdown menu will be displayed, where you can see the current server
   or change the server. Hitting change a server will now display a prompt with a
   detailed explanation and more space to enter another server address.

* Enhancement - Show notification if video playback is not possible on public share: [#4632](https://github.com/owncloud/enterprise/issues/4632)

   Before this PR no error notification was shown if a video can't be played due to
   browser incompatibility, for example, mov files on chrome.
   (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28746645)

   Now we will show a dedicated notification.

   https://github.com/owncloud/enterprise/issues/4632
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38858

* Enhancement - Improve login form: [#38506](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38506)

   This adjustment improves the overall look and feel of the login form.
   Furthermore, the placeholders have been replaced in favor of labels, the confirm
   button has been expunged from the password field and placed under the input
   fields.

* Enhancement - Automations in activity stream: [#38605](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38605)

   This adjustment provides a way to handle the activity stream for actions that
   were triggered by an automation (like the workflow app e.g.).

   https://github.com/owncloud/enterprise/issues/4222
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38605
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38630
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38970

* Enhancement - Add html template for calens: [#38616](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38616)

   Added an html template to render the changelog also in html format. This will
   give us better control over the rendering on the website.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38616

* Enhancement - Expired shares in activity stream: [#38631](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38631)

   Add a proper message in the activity stream for shares which expired
   automatically. Previous to this, the expiry was authored by a user, which is
   technically not true.

   https://github.com/owncloud/enterprise/issues/4455
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38631

* Enhancement - Use relative notification URLs: [#38639](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38639)

   Previous to this fix, absolute URLs were passed to the notification app. This
   could cause some CORS issues, hence we now use relative ones.

   https://github.com/owncloud/enterprise/issues/4250
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38639

* Enhancement - Add excludeActions parameter to registerDefaultActions function: [#38643](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38643)

   With this change we can pass now excludeActions to the registerDefaultActions
   function in fileactions.js, this allows us technically to omit specific file
   actions.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38643

* Enhancement - Improve tab headers UI: [#38653](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38653)

   With this change, tab headers will have a similar style to other nav elements,
   like the side nav. Also improved the UI on small display ratio, where elements
   in the second row were not properly left-aligned.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38653

* Enhancement - Add trashbin skip list to config: [#38704](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38704)

   With this change new config parameters has been introduced. Admins can now
   decide, based on file extensions, directory names and size, if a resource should
   not be observed by the trashbin and deleted immediately.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38704
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38960

* Enhancement - Remove google+ share button from personal settings: [#38705](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38705)

   Due to the google+ service has been declined, we won't show the google+ share
   button anymore.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38705

* Enhancement - Adjust the return type of the querybuilder's execute method: [#38714](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38714)

   The return type changed with the recent update of doctrine/dbal to version 2.13.

* Enhancement - Communicate user profile picture capability: [#38722](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38722)

   A new capability "profile_picture" has been added so that clients can know
   whether to fetch and render avatar images of users.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38722

* Enhancement - Allow apps to implement their own license: [#38737](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38737)

   Apps can implement their own license parser by extending the
   \OCP\License\AbstractLicense class. Note that storing the license will still be
   performed by ownCloud. This custom license can provide additional information
   that can be queried through the ILicenseManager.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38737

* Enhancement - Improve mobile user interface on files list: [#38748](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38748)

   This improvement solves the problem that files and folders with a longer name
   than 10 chars will cut off to 7 chars by hiding non-essential meta data. As well
   the uploading indicator text on a folders table row will now be displayed at the
   beginning to avoid UI glitches.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38748

* Enhancement - Resend invitation email: [#38774](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38774)

   Implemented an action to resend the invitation email for a user that has never
   been logged in yet.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38963

* Enhancement - Add more properties to the REPORT result: [#38787](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38787)

   File Search should be done in the future via WebDAV REPORT requests. ownCloud
   web is using it. In some cases with other search backends we have more
   properties to return. `<oc:search-highlights />` => returns am html formatted
   excerpt of the file content which is highlighting the matching words.
   `<oc:search-score />` returns a float number score value.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38787

* Enhancement - Improve admin external storage settings UI: [#38795](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38795)

   Before this PR no error notification was shown while an external mount point
   configuration was not able to load. This was only indicated with a red square
   with a long list of external mount points, this was not handy. Therefore an
   error notification will be shown with the dedicated external mount point which
   fails to load.

   As well improved the add external mount point functionality with opening the
   available for select while adding an external mount point. The select will have
   now a 'select all' item. These changes prevents the admin to expose the mount
   point unwanted to all users immediately.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38795

* Enhancement - Introduce new state to prevent scanning of shallow scanned folders: [#38804](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38804)

   Folders can be partially scanned, this means that a folder could have its
   closest contents scanned (the first level), but not deeper contents. Folder "/A"
   could be scanned but not "/A/B/C".

   Previously, we couldn't detect that a folder had been partially scanned, so we
   triggered another scan on that folder even though we already had data in the DB.

   Now, we can detect that the folder has been partially scanned to avoid another
   scan if it isn't needed. This leads to notable performance improvements in cases
   where a FS hasn't been scanned fully. Note that an initial scan is still
   required, and the performance will remain the same in this case.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38804

* Enhancement - Improve performance of the SMB log when it is inactive: [#38819](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38819)

   The SMB connector includes very verbose logs to trace what could have gone
   wrong. These logs are disabled by default, but although they're disabled we
   still need to check the state to decide whether we want to log or not.

   Now, the state check is faster and it takes less time to decide, so the overall
   performance of the connector is improved.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38819

* Enhancement - Introduce the patch for CVE-2019-11358: [#38841](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38841)

   Patched jQuery's `$.extend` method. The code in core doesn't contain any
   vulnerable invocations of `$.extend` this is just a preventive patch.

   https://github.com/DanielRuf/snyk-js-jquery-174006?files=1

* Enhancement - Introduce a remove license button in WebUI: [#38843](https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/38843)

   Before this PR, it was not possible, to remove any ownCloud license. This lead
   to an issue if someone enters an invalid license, a permanent message indicator
   was shown in the WebUI. With this PR it is possible to remove the license.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/38843
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38844

* Enhancement - Trigger file scan after accepting a federated share: [#38880](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38880)

   This is necessary as we need the fileId to pass it to the `remoteshare.accepted`
   event. The activity app can then hook onto this event and update the activity by
   setting the correct fileId.

   Also added a short translation for the SUBJECT_REMOTE_SHARE_RECEIVED activity.

## Details

* Bugfix - Show non-generic messages for 403 HTTP status to end user: [#395](https://github.com/owncloud/files_antivirus/issues/395)

   The real reason why 3rd party app canceled upload was ignored by Web UI and a
   generic 'You are not allowed to upload here' message was shown instead. Now 'You
   are not allowed to upload here' is shown only if a real reason is empty.

   https://github.com/owncloud/files_antivirus/issues/395
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38416

* Bugfix - Fix some code smells reported by SonarCloud: [#38147](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38147)

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38147

* Bugfix - Don't redirect if the browser ask for a .properties file: [#38181](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38181)

   In order to provide translations, the files_pdfviewer app requested a
   .properties file. This request failed because the server redirected it to the
   default page (the files view), so the app couldn't get the translations

   This redirection doesn't happen any longer, and the app can translate the UI
   elements now.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38181

* Bugfix - Show the share list even if some shares point to unavailable storages: [#38190](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38190)

   Previously, if some shares pointed to file nodes that belonged to unavailable
   storages, the share list wouldn't show any share due to the exception not being
   handled correctly.

   Now, the exception is handled. The affected shares will be ignored (an error
   message will appear in the log with the exception), and the rest of the shares
   will show in the web UI.

   Note that the steps to reproduce the problem are still unclear, and it might be
   impossible to reproduce the issue using recent ownCloud versions. So far, not
   only it seems required to have a share pointing to an unavailable storage, but
   also there has to be a pending modification for ownCloud to scan the file. Such
   conditions shouldn't be possible at the same time.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38190

* Bugfix - Fix a regression with theming of settings menu icons: [#38246](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38246)

   Default icons were loaded instead of the overrides from the enabled app-theme in
   the settings menu.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38246

* Bugfix - Determine unencrypted block size after begin operation: [#38249](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38249)

   Unencrypted block size of encrypted file can change with different encoding
   types. Unencrypted block size determination has been moved after begin operation
   in stream opening. In this way, EncryptionModule can decide block size after
   reading the header of the file.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38249

* Bugfix - Allow all users to see which groups they manage: [#38281](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38281)

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38281

* Bugfix - Fix the position of the user afterLogin-event: [#38289](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38289)

   Move the emitting event "user.afterlogin" in the method loginWithPassword.
   Previously it was placed after the prepareUserLogin-call which caused some
   issues with the encryption app using Symfony event listeners.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38289

* Bugfix - Fix file_target in response when creating a public link share: [#38291](https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/38291)

   The value of share_folder (if set in config.php) was being prepended to the
   file_target field in the response to a request to create a public link share.
   share_folder is not relevant to public link shares. It is no longer prepended.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/38291
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38295

* Bugfix - Fix rendering of leading/trailing spaces in the file name: [#38316](https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/38316)

   Leading and trailing spaces in the file name were stripped in the Web UI

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/38316
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38319

* Bugfix - Fix broken signature when a backup copy is generated: [#38375](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38375)

   Previously, when a user uploaded a file and then moved it to a shared folder in
   order for a second user to get the file, a copy of the file was generated inside
   the share owner's trashbin. This allowed the share owner to restore the file
   into the share again if needed. Using encryption, that backup copy was wrongly
   generated and couldn't be decrypted due to a wrong signature.

   This issue is now fixed, and the backup copy can be restored normally.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38375
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38452

* Bugfix - Prevent multiple calls by not registering the same listener twice: [#38385](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38385)

   Going back and forth among the file sections ("all files", "shared with you",
   etc) was making some event listeners to be registered twice or more times. This
   was causing the same ajax request to be called several times causing unnecessary
   load in the server.

   Now, these additional requests won't happen

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38385

* Bugfix - Prevent getting a version expiry list when no versions available: [#38390](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38390)

   Previous to this fix, when getting a version expiry list with an empty version
   array, ownCloud ran into an error. Not a critical one, but still not nice and
   spams the owncloud.log file.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/38373
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38390

* Bugfix - Add the owner to public link shares: [#38396](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38396)

   Add the owner to public link shares because we cannot retrieve this information
   otherwise.

   https://github.com/owncloud/files_spaces/issues/51
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38396

* Bugfix - Fix issues with duplicated file names in the same directory: [#38415](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38415)

   In some views like the "Shared by link"-list it is possible to have one or more
   files with the same name in one directory. This fix corrects plenty of wrong
   behaviors that such a scenario caused in the UI.

   https://github.com/owncloud/enterprise/issues/4412
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38415

* Bugfix - Fix command maintenance:mimetype:update-db --repair-filecache: [#38425](https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/38425)

   While running the command maintenance:mimetype:update-db --repair-filecache,
   existing records in the filecache table were not updated due to a faulty sql
   statement.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/38425
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38426

* Bugfix - Fix storage lookup in versions when storing a new version: [#38430](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38430)

   Versioning has been integrated with the new storage based versioning
   IVersionedStorage. Until today this was only tested with objectstore versioning
   which is hooked up as primary storage. When trying to access a versioned storage
   which is mounted as non-root this logic did not work out.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38430

* Bugfix - Fix behavior for user search at the API level: [#38489](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38489)

   The 'user.search_min_length' restriction could be circumvented when accessing
   the API directly.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38489

* Bugfix - Fix mispositioned ui elements after leaving viewerMode: [#38547](https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/38547)

   Until today, after leaving the viewer mode (e.G Pdf viewer) the action header
   table in the files list was mispositioned while checking an item. The download
   action and following items went out of sight.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/38547
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38552

* Bugfix - Fix problems moving files inside Gdrive storages: [#38553](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38553)

   Moving files inside a Gdrive storage broke, likely due to changes in the Gdrive
   server. This PR ensures it works again Moving files from local storage into the
   Gdrive storage is also fixed.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38553

* Change - Use OcsController and routes instead of API::register: [#37272](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/37272)

   Implemented OcsController and removed a separate file to register ocs routes.
   Also some deprecated and legacy OC_OCS classes removed. OcsController now checks
   CSRF token instead of OCS_API_REQUEST header.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/12454
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/37272

* Change - API changes to remove shares pointing to missing files: [#38152](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38152)

   If a file was completely deleted without unsharing first, the share would still
   exist in the DB even though it wouldn't be shown to the users. This change
   prepares a way to remove those shares.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38152

* Change - Update PHP dependencies: [#38188](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38188)

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38462

* Enhancement - Context menu for files in case multiple actions apply: [#38132](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38132)

   When triggering the default action for a file which can be opened or edited with
   more than one app, a new context menu is displayed. This menu will ask the user
   with which app the corresponding file should be opened.

   This also solves the problem with some apps which set themselves as default
   without asking or even informing the user.

   https://github.com/owncloud/enterprise/issues/4261
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38132

* Enhancement - New external storage: SMB Collaborative (shared file IDs)): [#38151](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38151)

   This new external storage allows the shared use of SMB/CIFS shares among users.
   Independent of the use all files and folders will have the same file id. This
   allows better collaboration especially in the area of tagging, comments, private
   links and any document collaboration like Office Online Server, Collabora and
   OnlyOffice.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38151

* Enhancement - Allow mounting a subfolder from Google Drive: [#38161](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38161)

   You can now define a subfolder from your Google Drive when mounting. This gives
   the ability to: subfolder = empty (like you have it without this enhancment)
   subfolder = name subfolder = name/$user When using encryption, only the
   subfolder when used gets encrypted.

   scrollbar
   has
   been
   made
   wider
   and
   darker.

* Enhancement - Improve file list tag management: [#38197](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38197)

   1. Introduce a new tab, where the tag input field will be displayed 1.1 Keyboard
   navigation in the input field's dropdown works now proper, in the past the user
   needed to hover over on item in the dropdown before the arrow keys could be used

   2. Replace the tag input field in the file list by a read only tag list 2.1
   Improving tag appearance to clarify that these are tags and no shares 2.2
   Clicking on a tag opens the tag tab 2.3 Tag tab and tag list are in sync, means
   that editing (select, unselect, rename, remove) tags will appear in the tag list
   immediately

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38197

* Enhancement - Improve the UX in the external storage settings page: [#38288](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38288)

   When a user adds or edits an external storage, the user will see a notification
   if the storage has been added or an error occured. When a user hovers over the
   status indicator, the user will see a pointer cursor, this clarifies that a
   click will result in a config (re-)check.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38288

* Enhancement - Prevent group assignment in Web UI if not supported: [#38298](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38298)

   This enhancement checks if users can be assigned to (or removed from) groups via
   Web UI. All group backends which do not support this functionality will be
   disabled in corresponding menus.

* Enhancement - New config parameter to define the encrypted file format: [#38337](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38337)

   A new config parameter has been introduced to define if encrypted files are
   written in the old or new format. The new format has a significant reduced
   filesize and is set to default. Files in the old format are still readable, only
   new encrypted files are written in the new format.

   https://github.com/owncloud/encryption/pull/224

* Enhancement - Display error/success message while changing the log level: [#38340](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38340)

   the select box.

* Bugfix - Do not emit "share.failedpasswordcheck" events for authenticated links: [#138](https://github.com/owncloud/brute_force_protection/issues/138)

   ShareManager was checking password of already authenticated public links. This
   situation led to wrong "share.failedpasswordcheck" events emitting in already
   authenticated links. This problem has been resolved by first checking link
   already authenticated.

* Bugfix - Avoid retrieving user root iteratively in share controller: [#4107](https://github.com/owncloud/enterprise/issues/4107)

   There was a performance problem that with many shares, the "share tab" was slow
   to display entries. Now the performance of displaying that tab should be better
   as we avoid retrieving the same information for all the shares

* Bugfix - SSL check when adding a public link to your ownCloud: [#4241](https://github.com/owncloud/enterprise/issues/4241)

   Prior to this fix, a SSL certificate check was performed when adding a public
   link to your ownCloud. As this check was done on the base URL of the server, it
   could cause some issues, for example endless redirect loops. This fix gets rid
   of the SSL check because the storage-check afterwards also checks the validity
   of the server's SSL certificate. This check is being made on /status.php, thus
   it likely wont end up in a redirect loop.

* Bugfix - Google Drive file modifications should not create duplicate files: [#25826](https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/25826)

   Change: Allow Storage backends to explicitly opt-in/opt-out of marking file as
   partial while uploading

   Existing files in Google Drive that were modified and saved (uploaded) would
   result in duplicate files of the same name. The root cause was appending .part
   to filenames for upload. This update first allows Storage to opt-out of .part
   filenames during upload and second opts out of .part filenames for Google
   Storage backend specifically.

   not possible. This problem has been resolved by extending related column length

* Bugfix - Fix problem with the market app installing an app using OpenIDConnect: [#37715](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/37715)

   The OpenIDConnect app uses an in-memory cache to store an OpenID session in
   order to avoid hitting the OpenID provider too much. After an app was installed,
   the prefix used to store information in the cache was changing. This was causing
   problems because the OpenIDConnect app thought the OpenID session was no longer
   valid and, as a consequence, it was logging out the user. In practice,
   installing an new app with the market app having logged in via OpenIDConnect
   would cause the user to logout.

   Now, the cache prefix only changes after an ownCloud upgrade. Installing an app
   won't cause the cache prefix to change, so this will fix the problem. The
   OpenIDConnect app will still find the stored session information after the new
   apps are installed.

* Bugfix - Fix decoding of calendars uri: [#37750](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/37750)

   In case an user had calendars uri containing special characters, for instance
   "persönlich", and this user was then invited to a calendar event, the event
   could not be created and a 404 was shown in the stack trace. Reason for this was
   the uri not being properly decoded. The behavior has now been fixed.

* Bugfix - Show all shares in the "shared with you" section: [#37786](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/37786)

   Previously, when a user received some shares from multiple remote servers and
   one of them was removed, the "shared with you" section didn't show any share
   even though the user still had other shares that were accessible in other remote
   servers.

   This is now fixed by ignoring those non-accessible remote shares. The rest of
   the shares will be shown.

* Bugfix - Add very minimal empty ODF files: [#37896](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/37896)

   These files contain no data at all. This guarantees that when the user opens a
   new document in the richdocuments app, the language of paragraph, page size,
   cell date format, currency, etc. will be according to the current locale.

   Previous files were in German. E.g. document language (spellcheck language) was
   set to German, spreadsheet tab name was "Tabelle", etc. It was incorrect for
   non-German users.

* Bugfix - Checksums will be kept when a file is uploaded or a version is created: [#37934](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/37934)

   Previously, reuploading the same file caused the checksum of the file to be
   reset. In addition, the checksum weren't being carried away when a new version
   of the file was created. This means that the versions didn't have a checksum.

   Both problems are now solved.

   In case avatars were disabled through config.php and a public link was created
   for some file, a "sharing is not allowed" message was displayed when leaving the
   sharing panel and trying to access it again for that specific file. The behavior
   has now been fixed.

* Bugfix - Clean the user's preferences only if they exist during user sync: [#37947](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/37947)

   Previously, the user's preferences were cleaned during the user:sync command.
   This was done regardless of the preferences existance, which was causing the
   "userpreference.afterDeleteValue" event to be triggered always, and then, as
   consequence, the admin_audit app was logging those events. Basically, this bug
   was causing a log flood by the admin_audit app even if those preferences weren't
   there in the first place.

   Now we check first if those preferences exist before attempting to delete them.
   If they exist, the admin_audit app will still log that deletion, but if not
   nothing happens because the deletion won't be attempted.

* Bugfix - Add a configurable number of retries on unsuccessful mountpoint move: [#37956](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/37956)

   Handling of conflicting mountpoints across different share backends was improved
   by adding a configurable number of the mountpoint rename attempts. Now when the
   mountpoint rename has been failed on the user filesystem initialization due to
   internal backend-specific reasons the used mountpoint name is considered to be
   taken, a new name is generated and the rename operation could be repeated
   several times until it either succeeds or rename attempts limit is reached.

   Action icons for the sharee list view, when you want to know who are you sharing
   to, where being pushed to the left when the avatars were disabled, breaking part
   of the layout.

   Those icons are now aligned.

* Bugfix - Fix file target in the accept share API call: [#37973](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/37973)

   If you had a custom share_folder set in the config.php file and the auto-accept
   feature for the internal user sharing was disabled, when a user accepted the
   user share, the file target in the API response contained the share_folder
   duplicated. This was limited to the API response.

   Now the API responds correctly, and the file target doesn't have the
   share_folder duplicated

* Bugfix - Pick the translations from templates included from other apps: [#38072](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38072)

   Some apps can include template parts from a different app, normally from core.
   From example, the activity app can include content from the core templates to be
   used in the activity email.

   The translated strings were picked from the original app even though the
   template was within core space. As a result, some string weren't translated
   because of the missing translation for those strings in the original app. Note
   that core had the strings correctly translated.

   Now the translations are picked from the requested app template as intended,
   instead of looking for them in the original app.

* Change - Rename phoenix to web: [#38199](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38199)

   Phoenix has been renamed to Web. You can now set these keys in config.php to

   - web.baseUrl - web.icon - web.label

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38201
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38212

* Enhancement - Cleanup encryption config values on disabling encryption: [#35980](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/35980)

   Occ encryption:disable command was changed to delete some encryption-specific
   config key-value pairs that made reenabling encryption not possible. A safety
   check was added to prevent disabling encryption until all files are decrypted.
   The occ encryption:disable command exits with an error code and message if the
   system still has any encrypted files.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/35980

* Enhancement - Add support for date expiration on remote shares: [#37548](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/37548)

   An expiration date can be set now for shares originating in your server. This
   feature behaves the same as the expiration for user, group and link shares.

   The expiration is controlled in the source server (server A). The target server
   (server B) won't know about the expiration. Once the share expires, the target
   server (server B) won't be able to access to those shares and it will remove
   them automatically

   This feature won't work for shares that are grabbed from a public link: if
   source server (server A) shares a file / folder via link, and an user from the
   target server (server B) adds that link to his ownCloud; in this case, this
   "remote share expiration" won't apply.

   In addition, the same as happens with user, group and link shares, the share
   recipient won't have control over the expiration date.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/37548

* Enhancement - Support pre-signed urls: [#37634](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/37634)

   Ocis-web (Phoenix) doesn't use cookies for authentication but the "Bearer"
   header.

   This means that we can only fetch data using XHR or the fetch API but cannot use
   URLs directly in image tags, also cannot download files directly.

   To solve this, we now support pre-signed URLs. This means that before creating
   an image tag or starting a download, we send an authenticated request to the
   server (OC 10 or OCIS) to ask for a pre-signed URL pointing at a specific
   resource. Then said URL can be forwarded either to an image tag (for thumbnails)
   or to another browser window to trigger a download.

* Enhancement - Add capability for the favorite files feature: [#37673](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/37673)

   The server is now exposing a new capability to advertise that the server
   supports the favorite files feature.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis-reva/issues/354
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/37673

* Enhancement - Add Support for SGI Image Previews: [#37758](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/37758)

   We added support for Silicone Graphics images previews. The following file
   extensions will be supported: .sgi, .rgb, .rgba, .bw, .int, .inta. These files
   will be associated with the mimetype image/sgi. This mimetype is not officially
   registered. This needs the imagick php extension to be installed.

   https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml
   https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.imagick.php

* Enhancement - Allow getting the share list filtered by share type via API: [#38000](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38000)

   Previously, the share API returned all the shares. There were some filters, but
   you weren't able to filter by share type. You couldn't get only your link
   shares.

   Now the API allows filtering by share type, along with the filters previously
   available. The web UI is using this filtering now.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38000

* Enhancement - GetShare API request's "subfiles" parameter allows new interactions: [#38053](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38053)

   Previously, the "subfiles" parameter required only the "path" parameter, and the
   rest of the parameters were ignored.

   Now, the "subfiles" parameter still requires the "path" parameter, but it also
   interacts with the "reshares" parameter as well as the "share_types" parameter
   to provide additional filtering capabilities

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38053

* Enhancement - Add new method in the PHP API interface: [#38054](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38054)

   The share manager interface in the PHP API has a new "getSharesByPath" method
   available

* Bugfix - Correct files_external:export output so it can be imported: [#37054](https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/37054)

   The output of files_external:export was not suitable to be used as input to
   files_external:import. This has been corrected.

* Bugfix - Add force option to delete user even if the user doesn't exist: [#37103](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/37103)

   When the command: ./occ user:delete -f foo

   If the user foo doesn't exist, the "force" option will try to delete any remnant
   that such user could have in the system. This includes data, shares,
   preferences, etc. This situation has been detected with some setups after the
   upgrade of ownCloud 9 to 10 with user_ldap active. Note that normal user
   deletion behaviour will still be used if the user exists even if the "force"
   option is used.

* Bugfix - Ensure ETag changes if a change is detected in a folder: [#37218](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/37218)

   Previously, if a change was detected in a folder, the ETag of the folder only
   changed if the folder's mtime changed. The ETag propagation to the root folder
   was working fine. If the folder's mtime didn't change, the ETag of the folder
   didn't change neither. This behaviour was causing problems in the desktop client
   because it was looking for a change, but it lost track once the client reached
   the modified folder because the ETag was the same. This was detected in the
   GDrive storage integration. Other storage works without problems. Basically, the
   desktop client wasn't able to download newly-added files in GDrive because it
   was unable to find where those files were.

   The changes fix the problem mentioned above, so the GDrive storage integration
   keeps the same behaviour as other external storages

* Bugfix - Stop writing data to the output buffer when the connection is not alive: [#37219](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/37219)

   Publicly shared video playback is sending a range http request to get the video
   content. In cases where the user is seeking to different positions of the video
   will result in a pretty high server load because all the video content is sent
   to the browser. Without detecting the connection state on server side all data
   is put to the output buffer. With this change the server processes will stop
   sending data as soon as the connection is detected as non-active.

   fixed to be integer.

   empty body. This change checks Content-Length and do not throw the exception on
   empty request body if Content-Length states that the empty body had been sent.

* Bugfix - Adjust user:sync --uid to use user backend iterator: [#37398](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/37398)

   It fixes the behavior for user:sync --uid that attempts to retrieve all user
   backend users without limit at offset, that is not supported by LDAP backend.
   Instead, proper iterator and search query has been used

* Bugfix - Allow clearing a user email address or display name: [#37424](https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/37424)

   The occ user:modify command would not allow the email or display name of a user
   to be cleared. This problem has been fixed.

   The email of a user can be cleared with: occ user:modify <username> email ''

   The display name of a user can be cleared with: occ user:modify <username>
   displayname ''

   And the effective display name reverts to the username.

   cleared.

* Bugfix - Logging of extra fields when logger does not have a writeExtra method: [#37453](https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/37453)

   If a logger in use does not have a writeExtra method then an error message would
   be generated when a log entry with extra data happens.

   This problem has been corrected. In this case the basic log information will be
   written without the extra data.

* Bugfix - Do not notify remote if both owner and sharer are local users: [#37534](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/37534)

   We tried notify remote for all federated shares. When a local share was reshared
   as a federated share it caused attempts to notify a local user via federated
   API. Under these conditions permission update caused 'Invalid Federated Cloud
   ID' error in Web UI. And the sharer was not able to delete the share at his end.

* Change - Keep the mtime of files and folders inside the tarball: [#37222](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/37222)

   Previously, when a folder or several files were downloaded, a tarball (.tar for
   mac, .zip for windows and linux) was created. Such tarball had the mtime of the
   files and folders inside with the time they were added into the tarball, not the
   one shown in ownCloud.

   This change makes the mtime of the files and folders inside the tarball to be
   maintained as they're shown in the ownCloud's FS.

* Change - Added federated shares scan cronjob depreciating incoming-shares:poll: [#37391](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/37391)

   We've fixed the behavior for federated shares poll command that in certain
   conditions was producing stale filecache entries, and replaced it by fed shares
   scan cronjob.

   ScanExternalShares that was added is a background job used to scan external
   shares (federated shares) that are eligible for scanning to ensure integrity of
   the file cache - i.e. satisfy preconditions as last user login, last scan and
   whether root storage updated.

   having a valid license key. This grace period will be available only once, and
   it will start just right after enabling the first enterprise app. Once the grace
   period ends, the enterprise apps will be disabled (unless you have a valid
   license).

   License management has been moved into core and it will replace the
   enterprise_key app. There is no big change in the functionality other than a
   couple of improvements: The settings page (admin's general section) now has a
   field to enter your license key from there, and it will take into account
   whether the config.php is read-only. You can also enter a license key from the
   grace period popup.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/37731

* Enhancement - Add 3 new events (before-fail-after) for share password validations: [#37438](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/37438)

   'share.beforepasswordcheck', 'share.afterpasswordcheck' and
   'share.failedpasswordcheck' events have been added for share password
   validations. Needs an update of brute_force_protection app to at least 1.1.0

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/37438

* Enhancement - Boost performance of external storages: [#37451](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/37451)

   We've cached some additional information that will boost the performance of
   external storages. This boost will be particularly noticeable for SMB
   connections

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/37451

* Enhancement - Change the behavior of the header menus: [#37490](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/37490)

   - Dynamically adjusting the width of the left menu - Changed the centering of
   the icons - Automatic wrap to a second line after the third entry - Hover effect
   in the left and right menu

## Details

* Bugfix - Show re-share public links to share-owner: [#36865](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/36865)

   Public links created by share-recipient were not visible to share-owner. This
   problem has been resolved.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/36865

* Bugfix - It's not possible to download externally encrypted files: [#36921](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/36921)

   Downloading was failing with the message "Encryption not ready: Module with id:
   OC_DEFAULT_MODULE does not exist." if the file was encrypted with another
   ownCloud instance.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/36921

* Bugfix - User:resetpassword with --send-email --password-from-env: [#36925](https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/36925)

   When trying to do command: occ user:resetpassword Anne --send-email
   --password-from-env

   If Anne does not have an email address setup then an error was logged in the
   ownCloud log.

   This has been corrected. Now the administrator is shown the correct error "Email
   address is not set for the user Anne"

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/36925
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/36926

* Bugfix - Avoid unneeded DB connections after a long download: [#36978](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/36978)

   After a long download, we needed to return the filesize, which needed a
   connection to the DB. The DB could have ended the connection due to an
   inactivity timeout. Now, the filesize is fetched before starting the download,
   so this timeout shouldn't happen any longer. We still need to update the
   checksum after the download is finished. In this case, we just log an error
   message and keep going.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/36978

* Bugfix - Remove full-stop from end of reset password message: [#36984](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/36984)

   When doing occ user:resetpassword username --password-from-env --send-email the
   message "Successfully reset password for username" had a full-stop at the end.
   Without --send-email there was no full-stop. The full-stop has been removed to
   make the messages consistent.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/36984

* Bugfix - Show pending remote shares at the Shared with you tab: [#37022](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/37022)

   Fixed missing pending remote shares in the file list at the Shared with you tab.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/37022

* Bugfix - Initialize the user before the transfer command: [#37038](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/37038)

   Trying to transfer the ownership of files to a user who hadn't logged in was
   causing problems because the FS of such user wasn't initialized and it wasn't
   possible to move the files there. The command appeared to work, but the files
   weren't moved.

   Now such user has the FS initialized so the transfer can be completed normally.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/37038

* Bugfix - Google drive files without extension 404: [#37044](https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/37044)

   Google Drive files without a file extension (".git/HEAD" for example) would
   result in a 404 response from the Web UI or desktop client. The problem has been
   fixed.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/37044
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/37045

* Bugfix - Fix public link upload remaining time estimation: [#37053](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/37053)

   Public link upload wrong remaining time estimation problem has been resolved.
   Also, the remaining time calculation logic has been changed for smoother
   performance.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/25053
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/37053

* Bugfix - Fix OCS Share API response for requests contain "include_tags" parameter: [#37084](https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/37084)

   Sending "include_tags" request parameter for OCS Share API was led to duplicated
   share entries in API response. This bug has been fixed by using share_id instead
   of file_id when populating tags. Also, the tag generation helper method
   simplified by customizing it for only shares.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/37084
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/37088

* Bugfix - Fix CLI zero exit code on startup errors: [#37098](https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/37098)

   Zero exit code was returned on startup with a missing app directory or a
   non-writable config directory. Now exit code is 1.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/37098
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/37148

* Bugfix - Add share type to the verifyExpirationDate hook: [#37135](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/37135)

   The verifyExpirationDate hook notifies the password_policy app about proposed
   expiration dates of shares. The share type was not being passed in the hook.
   This meant that the password_policy app incorrectly processed user and group
   share expiration dates. See the linked issue for details. The problem has been
   corrected.

   https://github.com/owncloud/password_policy/issues/287
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/37135

* Bugfix - Respect sharing.federation.allowHttpFallback config option: [#37153](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/37153)

   Federated share can be created for server without SSL, by setting config option
   sharing.federation.allowHttpFallback=true.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/37153

* Change - Allow dot in database name: [#20381](https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/20381)

   When installing ownCloud the database name is now allowed to contain a dot.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/20381
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/37020

* Change - Write crash log in case of parse error in config.php: [#36570](https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/36570)

* Change - Update symfony/polyfill (1.13.1 => 1.14.0): [#36955](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/36955)

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/36955

   thrown from within a closure.

* Enhancement - Add new occ command to check the cache for primary storages: [#37067](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/37067)

   This is a new occ command mainly for objectstores (objectstore and
   files_primary_s3 apps) as primary storages, but it can be used also for local
   primary storage.

   The use case is when a file is deleted directly from the primary storage without
   going through ownCloud. This is a scenario that shouldn't happen (modifying the
   primary storage outside of ownCloud isn't supported).

   The command will check if the target file can be accessed, and if not you can
   delete the information that ownCloud has (the command provides an option for
   this).

   The command will only work for the primary storage. It will ignore files that
   are accessible through a share (they need to be accessed directly), or files
   that are in an external storage.

## Details

* Bugfix - Stream_read not returning requested length for encrypted remote storage: [#34599](https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/34599)

   Stream_read was not always returning the requested length for encrypted remote
   storage. This could result in errors when downloading files. The issue has been
   corrected.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/34599
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/36546

* Bugfix - Fix links in setupchecks.js: [#36315](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/36315)

   Security tips at Settings -> Admin -> General had two broken links to the
   owncloud docs in the messages performing HTTPS and HSTS checks

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/36238
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/36315

* Bugfix - Fix Trash-bin api access: [#36378](https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/36378)

   Trash-bin API had allowed users to see the trash-bin content of other users.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/36378
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/36488

* Bugfix - Set 599 HTTP code on error: [#36413](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/36413)

   Previously, a hard crash, such as DB being down, was being reported with a
   stacktrace and a 200 HTTP code. In order to homogenize the behaviour with all
   the endpoints, we've changed the behaviour to return a 599 HTTP code and an
   empty content.

   In addition, we've included a new option in the config.php, "crashdirectory",
   which defaults to the "datadirectory" set, where the crash logs will be created.
   Note that normal errors will still be reported normally and will log into the
   owncloud.log file.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/36413

* Bugfix - Fix "files:transfer-ownership" in S3 multi-bucket setups: [#36464](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/36464)

   There were problems using the files:transfer-ownership in setups using
   files_primary_s3 against S3 storage with multibucket configuration, when some of
   the transferred files were shared with other people. This PR fixes that problem
   with the shares while transferring the files, allowing the
   files:transfer-ownership to finish correctly

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/36464

* Bugfix - Files shared with user cause purge of the trashbin content: [#36494](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/36494)

   Files_trashbin app counted incoming shares on calculation of the occupied space.
   It caused purge of the trashbin content when trashbin_retention_obligation is
   auto, user has quota set and incoming shares exceed 50% of this quota.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/36494

* Bugfix - Enhance validation for sender e-mail address for e-mail notifications: [#36505](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/36505)

   If a user wanted to use the e-mail notification mechanism in order to notify
   other users when creating public links as well as internal shares, an error was
   triggered if the e-mail address for this user was not set. The behavior has now
   been fixed.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/36505

* Bugfix - Suppress warning when resetting user password with masterkey encryption: [#36523](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/36523)

   When an admin wanted to reset a user's password on the User management page with
   masterkey encryption in place, a warning was displayed about data recovery not
   being available. The behavior has now been fixed.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/36523

* Bugfix - Receive multiple users for user sync command: [#36576](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/36576)

   Receive multiple users for user sync command. Previously when multiple users
   were returned, an exception was thrown and the command was aborted. In this fix
   we allow multiple users to be returned, and we check that the uid provided by
   the admin matches with the returned users. And if we find matches of more than
   one users with same uid, then we throw the exception that was thrown previously.
   The messages are kept intact.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/36576

* Bugfix - Fix null for empty path on Oracle: [#36610](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/36610)

   An empty path was fetched as null and not as an empty string. Due to the strict
   comparison it caused the list of mounts for the existing fileId to be empty. So
   the higher level code relaying on the mounts list got an empty list and did
   nothing.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/36610

* Bugfix - Return correct file size in the public files webdav API: [#36741](https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/36741)

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/36741
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/36778

* Bugfix - Do not dispatch DeclineShare event for nonexistent shares: [#36759](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/36759)

   DeclineShare event was dispatched even when the share had been not found in
   oc_share_external table. It caused sending unshare notification to the empty
   hostname.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/36759

* Bugfix - Remove part files when upload is cancelled for all public links: [#36761](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/36761)

   Remove part files when the upload is cancelled for public links. Prior to this
   change, it was noticed that for `Upload Only` and `Download / View / Upload` the
   part files were not cleaned up. With this change it does clean up.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/36761

* Bugfix - Fix one-time password (OTP) verify button width: [#36807](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/36807)

   The one-time password (OTP) verify button width has been extended.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/36807
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/36892

* Bugfix - Sharing with a user and group of the same name on the webUI: [#36813](https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/36813)

   When sharing with both a user and a group that have the same name it was not
   possible to adjust the sharing permissions of the 2nd share on the webUI. This
   problem has been corrected.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/36813
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/36766

* Bugfix - Fix provisioning API request for user information in mixed case: [#36822](https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/36822)

   When a user requested their own user information using the provisioning API, the
   request URL had to contain the UID in exactly the same case as was used when the
   user was created.

   The issue has been fixed so that the UID in the request URL is no longer
   case-sensitive.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/36822
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/36878

* Bugfix - Fix output of files_external:list command: [#36839](https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/36839)

   The files_external:list command was not displaying the correct information in
   the Options column. The Options column output has been corrected.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/36839
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/36841

* Bugfix - Add translation code for the Personal->Sharing section: [#36875](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/36875)

   Translation of the text in the Personal->Sharing section was not possible. This
   has been corrected. Translations of this text will become available after
   translators have provided the language-specific translations.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/36875

* Change - Validate reshare permissions and attributes based on supershare: [#36265](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/36265)

   This change provides a uniform way that reshare permissions and attributes are
   internally checked and enforced. There is no change to external behaviour.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/36265

* Change - Drop PHP 7.0 support across the platform: [#36290](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/36290)

   Support for security fixes for PHP 7.0 ended 1 Jan 2019 ownCloud core no longer
   supports PHP 7.0. Ensure that you are using PHP 7.1 or later.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/36290
   https://www.php.net/supported-versions.php

* Change - Don't report locking support in public.php and public-files endpoints: [#36402](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/36402)

   Public endpoints were reporting locking support even though the backend was
   rejecting those requests. This was causing a problem accessing a publicly shared
   document using LibreOffice opening the file through webdav (LibreOffice was
   complaining about a Forbidden error trying to lock the file)

   With these changes, LibreOffice will show a warning while opening the remote
   file (from a public link) if the file is already locked, letting the user choose
   what to do. If there is no lock, the file will be opened normally, but it won't
   be locked.

   The following changes are expected: * LOCK and UNLOCK methods won't be reported
   as allowed * Lock information (d:lockdiscovery) and support (d:supportedlock)
   will be shown in the propfind if requested (lock support is needed for
   LibreOffice to try to lock the file) * Trying to lock the file through the
   public link will either throw a Locked exception if there is a lock in place, or
   MethodNotAllowed if there are no locks (the Locked exception is needed for
   LibreOffice to show a popup warning the user that the file is locked)

* Enhancement - MariaDB 10.3 support: [#29483](https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/29483)

   MariaDB 10.3 is now supported

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/29483
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/36290

* Enhancement - Optimize memory consumption of occ files:checksums:verify command: [#31133](https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/31133)

   Memory consumption has been reduced by clearing memory usages of processed files
   and folders. Also, information messages of the command have been improved by
   showing the current processed user and the command run result.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/31133
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/36787

* Enhancement - PostgreSQL 10 support: [#33187](https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/33187)

   PostgreSQL 10 is now supported

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/33187
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/36290

* Enhancement - Regex version for blacklisted_files and excluded_directories: [#36360](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/36360)

   Adds two config options blacklisted_files_regex and excluded_directories_regex
   to enable more flexible pattern matches. With this you can, for example, disable
   the upload of Microsoft Outlook .pst files or the creation of directories
   containing <yourdate>_backup.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/36360

* Enhancement - Add an option to provide a mount in read only mode: [#36397](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/36397)

   Adds a new option in the mount settings to provide a mount in read only mode.
   This enables users or admins to provide a write protected mount independent of
   any backend settings. The sync client automatically respects this mount setting
   without any additional intervention.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/36397

* Enhancement - Add user-sync OCS API: [#36428](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/36428)

   We added a new user sync ocs api to provide an http api for external user
   provisioning systems to trigger a user-sync for a specific user.

   Authorization: The http API can only be executed by a user with admin
   privileges. Suggestion is to create a technical user who is in the admin group.

   Route: `curl -X POST http://your.domain/ocs/v2.php/cloud/user-sync/admin -v -u
   admin`

   Response: 200 - if sync was executed, 404 - given userId is unknown, 409 -
   multiple users have been found for the given user id - not unique user criteria

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/36428

* Enhancement - Support Oracle connection strings: [#36489](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/36489)

   To be able to use Oracle specific configuration settings like fail over support
   for Oracle connection strings has been added.
   https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/HABPT/config_fcf.htm#HABPT4967

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/36489

* Enhancement - Add enabled and disabled filter options to occ app:list command: [#36520](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/36520)

   The occ app:list command now supports the --enabled and --disabled options

   Occ app:list --enabled Displays just the enabled apps.

   Occ app:list --disabled Displays just the disabled apps.

   If a disabled app was enabled in the past, then the previously-enabled version
   of the app is now displayed in the disabled apps list.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/36520

* Enhancement - Optimize memory usage in Expire Trashbin Background job: [#36565](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/36565)

   The expire trashbin background job was consuming a lot of memory. The SQL query
   has been optimized by filtering out unnecessary records and not processing all
   users at once.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/36565
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/36602

* Enhancement - Share indicator on webUI: [#36572](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/36572)

   The file list in the webUI now shows a share indicator on files and folders that
   reside inside a shared folder. The sidebar sharing tab reveals a detailed view
   of the share-tree including share-recipients and the parent folder that has been
   shared.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/36572

* Enhancement - Expiration date for user and group shares: [#36573](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/36573)

   Shares with users and/or groups can now be given an expiration date. If the
   default expiration date is enabled then the default expiration is 7 days in the
   future. The default expiration date can be modified by the administrator. The
   default expiration date can be enforced as the maximum expiration date of a
   share. In that case the user can select a shorter expiration, but not longer.

   The settings are disabled by default, preserving the existing behavior. They can
   be enabled on the admin sharing settings page. They can be set independently for
   user and group shares.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/36573
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/36766
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/36847

* Enhancement - Reduce memory footprint of trash expiry jobs: [#36602](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/36602)

   The trash expiry job now expires the files in batches of users per script
   execution, instead of all users at once. This prevents growing memory related to
   how PHP PDO handles memory for many consecutive large queries. The trash expiry
   has been also moved to a dedicated trash expiry manager class that is optimized
   for background job access, while trash manager is used for online queries. Also
   some other minor memory optimizations have been applied.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/36602
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/36565

* Enhancement - Allow plus sign in username: [#36613](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/36613)

   The plus sign is now allowed in a username, e.g. John+Smith

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/36613

* Enhancement - MariaDB 10.4 support: [#36799](https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/36799)

   MariaDB 10.4 is now supported

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/36799
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/36800

* Enhancement - Enable DAV endpoints for trashbin and for public shares: [#36815](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/36815)

   DAV endpoint for trashbin and DAV endpoint for public shares were released in
   ownCloud 10.3.0. The endpoints were disabled by default and had to be enabled by
   setting dav.enable.tech_preview in config.php.

   These endpoints are now always enabled. There is no longer any need to set
   dav.enable.tech_preview in config.php.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/36815

* Enhancement - Additional share owner and initiator info in shares API response: [#36823](https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/36823)

   We've extended the OCS Share API response for share recipients to also include
   additional fields for the share owner and initiator. Additional fields are
   configured in the admin settings and can be set to email or user id and are
   useful to distinguish users who have the same display name.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/36823

* Enhancement - Add very verbose mode to remote shares polling: [#36832](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/36832)

   Additional output to the incoming-shares:poll command has been added when it is
   run with -vv

## Details

* Bugfix - Do not create error log about user home in user creation: [#30853](https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/30853)

   The server was producing an error log in every user creation and every first
   sync of a user account. This problem has been fixed.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/30853
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/32438
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/36365

* Bugfix - Fix sharing behavior to distinguish user and group having the same name: [#35488](https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/35488)

   Sharing a node with user and group having the same name was impossible. This bug
   was resolved by adding a share type check for share creation controls.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/35488
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/36359

* Bugfix - Fix share transfer in files:transfer-ownership command: [#36222](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/36222)

   Even when the path argument was given, files:transfer-ownership command was
   trying to transfer all shares of sourceUser. This situation caused random
   errors. We fixed this unintended behavior.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/36222

* Bugfix - Respect accounts.enable_medial_search setting for remote search: [#36225](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/36225)

   Users taken from a federated instance were always searched with medial search in
   the share autocomplete box. Config option accounts.enable_medial_search was not
   taken into account.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/36225

* Bugfix - Disallow sharing share_folder or it's parents: [#36241](https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/36241)

   Share_folder had share permission so it was possible for the user to share it
   along with some received shares. It caused weird behavior. So sharing
   share_folder (or any of it's parent folders) was prohibited. Deleting
   share_folder was already prohibited, but, the server did not return the correct
   node permissions. This situation led to dysfunctionality in client sides. This
   problem has been fixed.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/36241
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/36252
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/36337
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/36297

* Bugfix - Fix SMB access denied error while listing the contents of the folder: [#36242](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/36242)

   This happened in a DFS Replication (DFSr) folder, where such folder was visible
   even though the user didn't have permissions to read the folder. Using SMB2,
   windows threw an access denied error when a normal user was accessing that file.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/36242

* Bugfix - Avoid unnecessary "Avatar not found" logs: [#36281](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/36281)

   ViewOnlyPlugin was producing too many warning logs for users who do not have an
   avatar. This problem has been resolved by registering ViewOnlyPlugin only for
   files.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/36281

* Bugfix - Prevent Forbidden errors in the logs during file scan: [#36288](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/36288)

   When running files:scan exceptions were logged for guest users. This has been
   corrected.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/36288

* Bugfix - Occ system:cron only shows progess bar if option is set: [#36298](https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/36298)

   Occ system:cron will only output the progess bar if the newly introduced option
   --progress is set. When being executed from crontab occ system::cron shall only
   print out in case of error.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/36298
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/36304

* Bugfix - Do not try to set null parent Id in the file cache: [#36305](https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/36305)

   In some cases when the parent Id of a resource was null, it was still being
   stored. That was causing database constraint errors. The issue has been fixed.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/36305
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/36320

* Bugfix - LargeFileHelper::getFileSizeViaCurl is broken with newer libcurl: [#36319](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/36319)

   GetFileSizeViaCurl is a workaround for 32 bit platforms. Path separator was
   encoded when encoding the path but newer libcurl doesn't support that.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/36319

* Bugfix - Follow single-bucket initialization for multi-bucket setup: [#36329](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/36329)

   In multi-bucket object store configurations, store version information in the
   object storage the same as for single-bucket configurations.
