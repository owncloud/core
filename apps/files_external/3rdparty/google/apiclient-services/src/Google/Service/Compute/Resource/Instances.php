   *
   * For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude

   *
   * You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
   * `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are
   * not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields
   * to filter based on resource labels.
   *
   * To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within

   * (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND`
   * expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.

   *
   * You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
   * using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on the
   * `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest result
   * first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest
   * operation is returned first.
   *
   * Currently, only sorting by `name` or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.

   * of results.
   * @opt_param bool returnPartialSuccess Opt-in for partial success behavior
   * which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false
   * and the logic is the same as today.
