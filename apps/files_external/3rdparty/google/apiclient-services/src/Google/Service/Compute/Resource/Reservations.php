  /**
   * Retrieves an aggregated list of reservations. (reservations.aggregatedList)
   *
   * @param string $project Project ID for this request.
   * @param array $optParams Optional parameters.
   *
   * @opt_param string filter A filter expression that filters resources listed in
   * the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison
   * operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be
   * a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either `=`,
   * `!=`, `>`, or `<`.
   *
   * For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude
   * instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`.
   *
   * You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
   * `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are
   * not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields
   * to filter based on resource labels.
   *
   * To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
   * parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
   * (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND`
   * expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
   * For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel
   * Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ```
   * @opt_param bool includeAllScopes Indicates whether every visible scope for
   * each scope type (zone, region, global) should be included in the response.
   * For new resource types added after this field, the flag has no effect as new
   * resource types will always include every visible scope for each scope type in
   * response. For resource types which predate this field, if this flag is
   * omitted or false, only scopes of the scope types where the resource type is
   * expected to be found will be included.
   * @opt_param string maxResults The maximum number of results per page that
   * should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than
   * `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to
   * get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values
   * are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
   * @opt_param string orderBy Sorts list results by a certain order. By default,
   * results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.
   *
   * You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
   * using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on the
   * `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest result
   * first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest
   * operation is returned first.
   *
   * Currently, only sorting by `name` or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
   * @opt_param string pageToken Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to
   * the `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page
   * of results.
   * @opt_param bool returnPartialSuccess Opt-in for partial success behavior
   * which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false
   * and the logic is the same as today.
