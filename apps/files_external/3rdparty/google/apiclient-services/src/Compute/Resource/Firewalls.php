   * Retrieves the list of firewall rules available to the specified project.

   * @param string $project Project ID for this request.
   * @param array $optParams Optional parameters.
   *
   * @opt_param string filter A filter expression that filters resources listed in
   * the response. The expression must specify the field name, an operator, and
   * the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a
   * number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`,
   * `>=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you
   * can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name !=
   * example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match
   * substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The
   * `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For
   * example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ```
   * You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
   * `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are
   * not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields
   * to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions,
   * provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ```
   * (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By
   * default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include
   * `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = "Intel
   * Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
   * (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ```
   * @opt_param string maxResults The maximum number of results per page that
   * should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than
   * `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to
   * get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values
   * are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
   * @opt_param string orderBy Sorts list results by a certain order. By default,
   * results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You
   * can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
   * using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on the
   * `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest result
   * first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest
   * operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or
   * `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
   * @opt_param string pageToken Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to
   * the `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page
   * of results.
   * @opt_param bool returnPartialSuccess Opt-in for partial success behavior
   * which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is
   * false.
