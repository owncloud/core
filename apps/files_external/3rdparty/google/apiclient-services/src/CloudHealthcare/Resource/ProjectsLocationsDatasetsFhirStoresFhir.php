   * [R4](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/R4/http.html#search)) using the
   * search semantics described in the FHIR Search specification
   * ([DSTU2](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/DSTU2/search.html),
   * [STU3](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/STU3/search.html),
   * [R4](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/R4/search.html)). Supports four
   * methods of search defined by the specification: * `GET [base]?[parameters]`
   * to search across all resources. * `GET [base]/[type]?[parameters]` to search
   * resources of a specified type. * `POST [base]/_search?[parameters]` as an
   * alternate form having the same semantics as the `GET` method across all
   * resources. * `POST [base]/[type]/_search?[parameters]` as an alternate form
   * having the same semantics as the `GET` method for the specified type. The
   * `GET` and `POST` methods do not support compartment searches. The `POST`
   * method does not support `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` search
   * parameters. On success, the response body contains a JSON-encoded
   * representation of a `Bundle` resource of type `searchset`, containing the
   * results of the search. Errors generated by the FHIR store contain a JSON-
   * encoded `OperationOutcome` resource describing the reason for the error. If
   * the request cannot be mapped to a valid API method on a FHIR store, a generic
   * GCP error might be returned instead. The server's capability statement,
   * retrieved through capabilities, indicates what search parameters are
   * supported on each FHIR resource. A list of all search parameters defined by
   * the specification can be found in the FHIR Search Parameter Registry
   * ([STU3](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/STU3/searchparameter-
   * registry.html), [R4](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/R4
   * /searchparameter-registry.html)). FHIR search parameters for DSTU2 can be
   * found on each resource's definition page. Supported search modifiers:
   * `:missing`, `:exact`, `:contains`, `:text`, `:in`, `:not-in`, `:above`,
   * `:below`, `:[type]`, `:not`, and `:recurse`. Supported search result
   * parameters: `_sort`, `_count`, `_include`, `_revinclude`, `_summary=text`,
   * `_summary=data`, and `_elements`. The maximum number of search results
   * returned defaults to 100, which can be overridden by the `_count` parameter
   * up to a maximum limit of 1000. If there are additional results, the returned
   * `Bundle` contains a link of `relation` "next", which has a `_page_token`
   * parameter for an opaque pagination token that can be used to retrieve the
   * next page. Resources with a total size larger than 5MB or a field count
   * larger than 50,000 might not be fully searchable as the server might trim its
   * generated search index in those cases. Note: FHIR resources are indexed
   * asynchronously, so there might be a slight delay between the time a resource
   * is created or changes and when the change is reflected in search results. For
   * samples and detailed information, see [Searching for FHIR
   * resources](/healthcare/docs/how-tos/fhir-search) and [Advanced FHIR search
   * features](/healthcare/docs/how-tos/fhir-advanced-search). (fhir.searchType)
