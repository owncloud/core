ownCloud Core is the server-side component of ownCloud Classic, providing file storage, synchronization, and sharing trusted by over 200 million users worldwide. It includes WebDAV, CalDAV, and CardDAV servers, a plugin architecture for apps, user and group management, encryption support, external storage backends, and a comprehensive REST API. The server runs on PHP with support for MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, and SQLite databases.

## Part of ownCloud Classic

This is the main repository for [ownCloud Classic](https://github.com/owncloud/core). It is the foundation that apps like [Activity](https://github.com/owncloud/activity), [Calendar](https://github.com/owncloud/calendar), [Contacts](https://github.com/owncloud/contacts), and many others extend. The server is available as a Docker image on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/owncloud/server).

For the next-generation ownCloud platform, see [ownCloud Infinite Scale (oCIS)](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis).

## About the ownCloud OSPO

The [Kiteworks Open Source Program Office](https://kiteworks.com/opensource), operating under
the [ownCloud](https://owncloud.com) brand, launched on May 5, 2026, to steward the open source
ecosystem around ownCloud's products. The OSPO ensures transparent governance, license compliance,
community health, and sustainable collaboration between the open source community and
[Kiteworks](https://www.kiteworks.com), which acquired ownCloud in 2023.

### License Migration to Apache 2.0

The OSPO is driving a strategic relicensing of ownCloud repositories toward the
[Apache License 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0), following
the [Apache Software Foundation's third-party license policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html).

Individual repositories will migrate as their audit is completed. The LICENSE file
in each repo reflects its **current** license status (not the target).

**Current license: AGPL-3.0** (Category X per Apache policy -- cannot be included in Apache-2.0 works).

Migration prerequisites for this repository:

- **CLA/DCO coverage**: All past contributors must have signed agreements permitting relicensing
- **Copyleft dependency audit**: All AGPL/GPL dependencies must be replaced or isolated
- **KDE heritage review**: Any code with KDE-era copyrights requires legal analysis
- **Complete relicensing**: AGPL-3.0 is a strong copyleft license; migration requires full relicensing of all files, not just a header change
